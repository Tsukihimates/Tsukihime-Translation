Oh dear, Dead End!
<Page2>
Hey, Tohno-kun!
 Stop right there, you are%{n}under arrest for speeding!
<Page3>
Why do you look so happy, Ciel?%{n}
There's a BBQ'd protagonist right here, y'know?
<Page4>
Pardon me. The big battle had finally begun,%{n}
so I got a bit carried away...
<Page5>
This Q&A corner is brought to you by your guiding
 instructor, Ciel, and this bystander Neco...//to be rechecked outsider Neco
<Page6>
Welcome to "Teach Me, Ciel-Sensei!"
<Page7>
Depending on how you've played,%{n}
this may have been your first dead end.
<Page8>
Well, then, it simply must have been the%{n}natural choice to make,//The first part 'in that case' isn't quite the nuance here. If we take out 'how do I put this' it makes it clearer: 'It was just that natural of a choice, or atleast this time it was'. That said, it might need some better wording. Perhaps italics on 'that'?
 or at least, this%{n}time it was.
<Page9>
But let's stay calm and assess the situation carefully.%{n}
After all, humans cannot survive being on fire!
<Page10>
Well, from a feline point of view,%{n}
I can appreciate this kind of dead end nya.
<Page11>
Think about it, there's a woman of unrivaled beauty fighting%{n}in front of you.//絶世 as in peerless/unequaled, so perhaps instead of 'beautiful woman', you could go for 'peerless beauty'
 Who in their right mind could keep their%{n}cool? There's a phrase for this.
<Page12>
"Picking chestnuts out of the fire for%{n}someone else's picnic.%{n}//This seems like nonsense since its a reference to Japanese idiom. But you'd have to rephrase so much of this conversation since they start riffing on this stuff that I'm honestly not sure what to do. I'll leave the comment here just in case any editor is brave enough to tackle it.
Welcome, welcome, well-done."
<Page13>
What do you think?%{n}
Does it irresistibly whet your appetite, mademoiselle?
<Page14>
No, I have no idea what you're saying...%{n}
Although, I personally like my meat%{n}well-done...
<Page15>
Oh really? That was unexpected.%{n}
You don't like your steak a little bloody even though%{n}you're from France?
<Page16>
I like tender meat the most when it comes to beef curry,
 but rare steak is a bit... much.//this is not 'mentally', quite the opposite. 生理的 literally means 'physiologically'. Think of it more like 'instinctively' or something like that. Also, with how Japanese works with implications and what not, it might be worth adding 'too much' after 'a bit' here. In English thoughts aren't ended halfway like this.
<Page17>
The people who like rare, or something like %{n}raw sashimi,
 would be someone like Akiha-san,%{n}I guess.
<Page18>
I mean, Japanese people are known for preparing sashimi%{n}//replaced 'cooking' with 'preparing' 
from raw fish, right? It's hard to believe.//replaced 'out of' with 'from'
<Page19>
You fool. Fish is better the fresher it is.//replaced 'more fresh' with 'fresher'
<Page20>
If you don't take my word for it,%{n}
I'll buy you a round of S-rank sushi next%{n}time.//回らない寿司 as in not 回転寿司 (sushi-go-round, or whatever people call it in English), which is more of a fastfood approach to sushi. She's gonna treat her to the good stuff, is the implication.
<Page21>
You do like 'karei' (righteye flounder),%{n}right, otaku?//Otaku here is actually used in its original meaning, as a pronoun. ruby maybe? also recheck the pun
<Page22>
...Well, it's not like I eat it%{n}
every day either...
<Page23>
Sometimes seafood is the way to go...
<Page24>
Right. It seems that we have completely different tastes.//line breaks
Oh well. Come on, wrap it up. We'll have dinner after%{n}this.
<Page25>
R-Right, of course.//line breaks
We're still in the middle of the%{n}lesson.
<Page26>
Well, suffice to say, a fight between vampires%{n}
is extremely dangerous, so please stay calm and watch%{n}the fight from a safe distance.
<Page27>
Don't worry. I'm sure Tohno-kun will have his chance to%{n}shine.
 So until then, make sure that you preserve your stamina!//more like 'So until then, make sure to keep your stamina preserved' if we are being literal. Perhaps 'make sure you preserve your strength' would be better.
<Page28>
―――Right, that's a job well done!%{n}
We're going straight to Messiaen!//I'm not certain about this, but I think this is actually supposed to be 飯案 (obscure word, basically means 'meal plans') rather than a reference to some crummy old French composter. <-- Messiaen is Ciel's favourite curry house, so corrected back to original.
<Page29>
...This time it's seafood curry!
<Page30>
Told ya. ☆
