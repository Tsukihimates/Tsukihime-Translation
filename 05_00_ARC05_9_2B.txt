<Page1>
I stoop down in front of Arcueid.
I put my knees and hands on the ground.
<Page2>
An invisible arm runs through the ground.
Arcueid transforms the terrain into fine rubble like before――― no, the scale this time is much greater.//ruby dots <こ|・><の|・><地|・><形|・><を|・><変|・><動|・><さ|・><せ|・><た|・>
<Page3>
The upheaval of earth gives off the impression of a great explosion.
The power of an overwhelming number of fragments. If Vlov's cold air is like a blizzard, then what Arcueid did is like an earth tsunami.
<Page4>
A flying spear of ice faced with this wall of earth can't get past as anything more than droplets.
The mass, 50 meters in height and 7000 tons in weight, hurls toward Vlov, ready to swallow him whole.
<Page5>
However, the knight is unperturbed by the natural disaster which turns the earth's surface inside out.
The massive waves of earth and sand are pushed back by a single thrust of his steel lance.
<Page6>
Vlov must have seen through the downpour of debris.
He must have seen Arcueid kneeling from exhaustion after turning over the bedrock with the last of her strength. That the threats were not using the upturned sediment as a smokescreen.
<Page7>
In the face of the towering wave, the man managed to reclaim his once normal thinking.
No, it was two minutes ago to be exact.
His mind, which should have lost all sanity from the constant barrage of cold, has been trying to function normally ever since the moment he jumped away from the human closing in before him.
<Page8>
'That human has a plan to kill me.'
'Although the reason is uncertain, I have no doubt that is the case.'
A remnant of a time when he was normal.
The knight's spirit which had been forged during the Medieval Dark Ages has broken the curse that controls his body.
Spirit and will of only some twenty years defeating the madness of over a thousand?
<Page9>
He knows well the kind of miracle this is.
Moments like this come and go. Nothing more than a trick of the imagination before killing the human. A dream of an afterlife that will never come.
Never indulge yourself during combat―――Such human-like joy will freeze over in a matter of seconds.
<Page10>
"――――――Ha."
That is why he cannot help but be inflamed by this turn of events.
The enemy's aim is clear.
The enemy will approach using the dust as a shield.
Cutting is his weapon. This wall is like a door to him. He will cut it open and step into the space.
<Page11>
He readies his lance.
By all rights, he knew that he needed to crush the enemy hiding behind the massive wave.
<Page12>
There is no need to respond to the enemy's tactics.
His strategy is to crush it all.
There is still plenty of power left in him.
The man has ten humans' worth of the finest blood in stock.
However―――
<Page13>
"That I cannot do. No matter what I shall never consume these souls."//choose I cannot consume these - and only these - souls, no matter what, Only these souls I can never consume, no matter what, Only these souls I can never consume, no matter what, It is these souls - and only these - that I cannot consume, no matter what, These souls are the only ones I can never consume, no matter what
For him, it was warmth. Blood for the sake of keeping the flame alive, preserved for all eternity.
<Page14>
He didn't mean to look down on the human.
He already understood that that thing was an exception that evaded description.//works with two thats right?
The man had a feeling the second that thing got close, it would all be over for him.
But even so, there are some things he can't compromise on.
<Page15>
"―――Shatter―――!"
In which case he throws half of his remaining strength into his lance, reading that he was being too lenient.//ruby dots <手|・><ぬ|・><る|・><い|・>
<Page16>
The huge wave of debris collides and scatters.
It was not enough. The only thing pierced was the object in front of him.
That was just a blow to ensure his own safety. The enemy could not possibly be hit by such an attack.
He will definitely come. He will appear no matter the cost.
<Page17>
"But―――"
As sad as it is, that is the limit of humanity.
A human cannot pass through a rain of debris on his own.
He cannot even make use of support from the Princess of the True Ancestors to that end.
<Page18>
It will all be over when the downpour comes to an end.
As long as he can see the man's figure, he will never allow such a surprise attack aga―――
<Page19>
"――――――"
The man's eyes widen as the vast expanse in front of him comes into view.
―――Nothing. There isn't a single trace of him anywhere.
<Page20>
Not even his shadow running away.
Perhaps he died from the blow of the lance? Impossible. The man scolds himself for raising such a foolish question.
And above all, a chill of death runs down the man's spine stronger than anything before.
<Page21>
For a mere second, the man's thoughts drifted away from the 'enemy'.
It is obvious that he is drawing near.
If the enemy cannot be located, then there must be some mistake in his assumptions.
He predicted that the sediment would be used as a shield.
However, if it wasn't used as a shield―――
<Page22>
"――――――Then it must be a road!"
The man looks up to the sky. To the enemy's figure outlined by moonlight.
Above lie the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, shining blue like an apparition.
<Page23>
The debris that consumed Vlov wasn't the only thing that Arcueid sent flying.
That bedrock was the true objective.
There I was, tied up and flown overhead outside the vampire's vision at the area unaffected by the ultra-low temperatures.//ruby dots <超|・><低|・><温|・><の|・><影|・><響|・><を|・><受|・><け|・><な|・><い|・><ヤ|・><ツ|・><の|・><頭|・><上|・><に|・>
<Page24>
The tsunami of earth and sand crashes 30 meters below the ground.
Me and him. The final empty space between us.
I reevaluate my choices along with their consequences.
<Page25>
If this is successful, I, Tohno Shiki, will lose both my legs.
Even if I were to survive, I won't be able to walk again for the rest of my life.
I imagine that sort of future in great detail.
―――I don't mind. For the gift of these two seconds, it's more than a satisfactory conclusion.
<Page26>
A mere second to locate the enemy.
As much as I respect his perceptiveness, a mere second was too long.
<Page27>
"Huh? But wouldn't you fall down somewhere along the line?
There's nothing I can do when it comes to that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page28>
"―――I need you to create a path for me."
<Page29>
The soaring bedrock is assembled like a puzzle.
A hastily constructed path tied by ivy gliding through the air.
Aside from the difference in altitude, both of us are now on the same playing field.
<Page30>
"―――Now then."
I estimate the average chance of survival.
Before I begin, I establish that single point.//ruby dots <一|・><点|・>
The route is set.
A one-way road spanning 30 meters in a mere two seconds.
"It's showtime, vampire."
<Page31>
The gliding descent begins.
A short slide towards death itself.
<Page32>
I've completely given up on responding to him at this point.
I can only make one decision per second with my current speed of thought.
Within the two seconds before I fall, I focus all my abilities on only two points.
<Page33>
When it comes to this decision, every move I make faces death.
Even among these choices, this one has a low chance of survival.
I have to assume this is a situation where I won't survive no matter what I do.
<Page34>
I've identified two cases that don't come out with me on top. // 　マイナス地点 wtf does this even mean?, substitute the percent with something
Anything other than that has a survival rate of probably around 10%. I'll only take those into consideration. If it's 10%, then it's fine.
<Page35>
The problem is the cases with a 0% chance of a positive outcome. // ゼロの地点. I've heard ゼロ地点 as like 'ground zero', but that doesn't work here., recheck the entire page
In those cases, only absolute death awaits. I have no chance of survival, regardless of my human abilities.
I'll give it everything I've got to change that 0% into 1%.
<Page36>
In order to overcome those two worst-case scenarios, I steel myself.
There is no consciousness left to allocate to any other event.
So now that I've started to descend, I don't have the ability to think about how to respond to him.
<Page37>
But what if there are more than those two worst-case-scenarios?
I do not consider that. I don't have the capacity to go beyond three branches in my mind. If more are required, victory belongs to him. That would just mean that his power was stronger than I can imagine.
<Page38>
The ice spears shoot towards the falling prey like they are overlapping one after another.
It's like the jaws of a beast. It's terrifying, but it doesn't matter.
I don't know if it's because of my instincts telling me or something.
But I was confident of what was coming. And against that frightening counterattack that should have killed me...
<Page39>
―――Ten meters.
The first chance for failure.
The sensations of my limbs, the fine-tuning of my muscles, and the sudden braking of my torso and its return.
My downward trajectory which couldn't be changed originally gets altered after witnessing that angle of fire...!
<Page40>
A lump of iron passes right next to me.
My gamble on that '0%' chance paid off.
One second left. Victory is mine. He is already out of options.
<Page41>
I've decided that the chance for failure is 'that moment'.
I'll deal with the impact of this fall and kill him before my body shatters.
I don't know what will happen after that. I'll just focus my undivided attention on cutting his 'lines'.
<Page42>
That's why.
If he makes one more move than I predict...
<Page43>
"――――――"
Even if I can change the situation halfway, the notion wouldn't even occur to me.
That's why I gave up thinking.
If I was going to die, I would have died the moment I started to glide.
This is fine.
I'm sure that if he skewered my brain here, I wouldn't notice it at all.
<Page44>
―――The second chance for failure.
The extreme conditions of 100℃ stops my entire body.
My instinct to prepare for landing,
and the reasoning necessary to advocate for the significance of life has already been left behind with the night sky.
<Page45>
"Vlov...!"
I transfer the kinetic energy from my thigh to my waist, from my waist to my back muscles, and from my back muscles to the swing of my right hand holding the knife.
It won't stop even if my muscles no longer function.
I am a killing machine that works on raw sensory input alone. The only thing I need to focus on is capturing the lines.
<Page46>
I see a light at the very edge.
The whirling will of atoms. The predetermined lifespan of matter.
The pit-like point of death.
<Page47>
Despite having abandoned all thought, I understand through input alone.
If lines represent the death of life, then that 'point' represents the death of existence.
Any immortal being or monster that gets killed like that would meet a repulsive fate. A view of the end of the universe.
<Page48>
But I really don't care about that discovery.
My whole body shakes with a feeling far stronger than that.
<Page49>
A billhook held in Vlov's hand. Even after unleashing his giant, deadly lance, this vampire was convinced that I was coming and chose to intercept me.
At this stage. Against a foul opponent like me.
<Page50>
"――――――"
This guy is the real deal. I don't know his standards as a vampire, I'm not interested in that. He is simply an extraordinary murderer.
<Page51>
I can't help but hate him.
If he was in his right mind and wasn't a vampire, he would've been a knight to be envied.
Even if he's a shadow of his former self now.
<Page52>
That weapon will never have a chance to reach me.
Turning, dodging, and twisting.
My eyes spot a line along his center.
<Page53>
In an instant, the atmosphere reverts back to its original temperature.
The cold wave that was far removed from any natural phenomenon disappears along with the man's life.
In the middle of it all,
"―――What, is this?"
The vampire monologues as he sways.
<Page54>
"...I do not know this wound. I cannot remember this loss.
This―――indescribable feeling of the air on my skin, is something I lost some time ago."
<Page55>
I don't know what he's talking about,
or which country's language he's speaking in.
But his gentle voice reminds me of a poet celebrating the spring.
<Page56>
"Ah―――I feel no pain, nor do I feel the cold waves.
It is terrifying but familiar.
It is entirely as if I have become a dead man."
