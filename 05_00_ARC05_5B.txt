<Page1>
It was just like a human missile.
Arcueid descended from a height of 80 meters above Vlov.
<Page2>
No, it was more like she flew.
While in the air, she took aim and angled herself before accelerating like a missile.
<Page3>
Sand and debris spews up in the air.
The wind whips up a cloud of dust that sweeps the area.
The river of flame that sweeps across the downtown area is eradicated by that single blow.
<Page4>
The policemen that surround Vlov in the distance are blown away, incapacitating most of them. They are divided into two groups: those who became unconscious after suffering a head injury and those who lose their will to fight.
It's not surprising.
<Page5>
"In-Incre..."
After the dust settled, this is the result.//to be rechecked "this is the result" sounds bad apparently, なにしろ
Arcueid's rapid descent not only shattered the area around Vlov, but also a large portion of the downtown area at the north gate.
<Page6>
So that's what she meant by 'dropping them underground'.
The land had sunk over 40 meters.
<Page7>
It felt like watching an incredible force of nature. Its grandeur is on the same level as the Amazon jungle or Niagara Falls.
"Cut me some slack, you idiot――――!"
Of course, I'm not praising her in the slightest.
<Page8>
"But damn, that was cool. Was that by accident, or was it part of her plan!?"
There aren't any casualties from what I can see from the rooftop.
The policemen who were outside the blast radius tended to the knocked-out officers and withdrew from the site of the explosion to escape.
<Page9>
As a result, this entire area is now completely deserted.
This――― this method of clearing out people is way too over the top...!
<Page10>
"......!"
Did that flame come from Vlov?
Whether Arcueid missed or Vlov dodged the attack, either way, he is still alive.
<Page11>
...A monster that doesn't go down even from a strike like that.
As if to chase it down,
a white shadow challenges the flame's source in the cloud of dust.
<Page12>
'Make sure you find me afterwards―――'//to be rechecked ちゃんと後からついてきてね means Make sure to follow (after) me
Arcueid's words surface from the back of my mind.
...I'll think about that stuff later.
Right now, I need to hurry and get to the ground...!
<Page13>
"Hah, hah, hah, ha―――!"
I run down the stairs.
I cut the lock of the door to the rooftop with a knife.
<Page14>
"...Hah, hah, ha―――ah."
I run down the stairs, relying on the emergency lights.
...My resolve is disrupted by my erratic breathing.
<Page15>
All I have to do is cut through Vlov's 'lines'.
First, Arcueid will battle him and then restrain him with her chains.
And then that's where I come in.
I'll approach him, cut his lines and dismantle his body.
<Page16>
Arcueid's plunge back then was extraordinary.
So I believe it's definitely possible that Vlov can be pinned down.
However―――
<Page17>
"―――But, still―――"//to be rechecked tl suggestion 1: replace 'still' with 'even so', 2: replace 'still' with 'even so' (note: the word used needs to be the same on both lines if a change is made.), 3: suggested new version: Is Arcueid's view of him still correct?
...Still, Vlov is in good condition.
Is Arcueid's assessment accurate?
If it is wrong by any chance, she will be handicapped by her wound.
<Page18>
...In the worst-case scenario, I would have to fight Vlov alone―――
No, that's not possible.
There is no worst-case scenario in our minds. It's not that we didn't think about it, there is just no reason to.
<Page19>
That's because if Arcueid is to be defeated by Vlov, the only choice I would have left is to run away.
<Page20>
"Hah――――――hah."
I reach the elevator.
I head inside and press the button for the first floor.
There's no more time for hesitation.
This isn't the time to hesitate in the first place.
I take a deep breath. I check my condition. I can move properly at the very least.
<Page21>
Only the fingers holding the knife are frozen in place, as if they aren't part of my body.
<Page22>
"――――――"
Could this be fear?
Am I afraid of confronting that violent... of confronting that monster?
If that's the case, then it's fine.
It's normal for people to be afraid of that thing. Of facing someone that could kill you just by being in close proximity. How can you call yourself human if you aren't afraid of that?
<Page23>
That's why,
if there is a problem, it would be,
<Page24>
"――――――"
...It would be,
rather than being killed, it is killing him that I should be afraid of.
<Page25>
"Ha―――――h."
My breathing speeds up.
My heart is pounding restlessly like it's detached from my body entirely.
<Page26>
...I reach the first floor.
I adjust my grip on the knife and run towards the newly formed site of the explosion.
