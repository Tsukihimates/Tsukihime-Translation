## Modified allscr.mrg resources

In order to fix some text issues, it has been necessary to modify some of the
game engine scripts for certain days. This directory tree contains the modified
script files and a utility to re-pack these edited scripts into a .mrg file that
can be added to romfs.

In order to run the mrg generation script, you will need the `mzx_compress`
and `mzp_compress` tools from the
[This Repository](https://github.com/rschlaikjer/mangetsu).
