Not sure what exactly is going on here, but the edited scripting to fix the
newlines causes this QA scene to freeze on this conditional.
We see the LV00*00 flags come up a lot, but it's not clear how exactly they get
set.

It's also just not clear what the point of this conditional even is - examining
the difference between these renderings, one of them has a slightly fucked up
nose, but that's it? Why would you sometimes show a fucked up nose?
