It has to be sliding.
No, the correct term is closer to falling.
...But can I do it? It's up to fate whether I can make it there or not.
<Page2>
There's no way that it will end up being safe. Even if everything goes well, the impact of the landing will tear my muscles and break my bones.
Will I really be able to endure that pain?
<Page3>
I stop the projectiles in their tracks as manifestations of my worries.
That was close. Thank goodness.
Because of that, I can finally make my decision.
I just need to bear the burden. From the beginning, I have always been insensitive when it comes to death.
I'll also spend every second of my time thinking about how to kill him.//to be rechecked, needs improvement
<Page4>
I turn around and run to Arcueid in the rear.
My energy is completely depleted from the excessive movement.
I can't take even one more step forward.
The enemy I must approach is 50 meters away on the other side.
<Page5>
It doesn't matter.
In any case, the horizontal distance has no bearing on my choice.//ruby dots <横|・><軸|・><の|・><距|・><離|・>
<Page6>
"Arcueid, can you do that thing again from earlier?!"
"What do you mean by 'that thing'?!"
<Page7>
I tell Arcueid about my intent.
The explanation ends with a single word.
After a moment of bewilderment, Arcueid looks at me and agrees as if she has no choice.
<Page8>
"...If we do it on that scale, I'll run out of energy to spare.
But you're okay with that, right? You won't be able to escape anymore."
<Page9>
I nod without a care.
I don't have the strength to speak up. Or rather, has she been looking for an opportunity like this the entire time?!
<Page10>
"Huh? But wouldn't that mean you'll fall down halfway?
I can't really do anything about that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page11>
Even though I wanted to fix my breathing a little, I ended up lecturing her in a loud voice.
And over there,
<Page12>
"―――!"
There's no time to explain.
The spears of ice rush towards me. Vlov plans to mercilessly pierce Arcueid through me.
<Page13>
"Just do it, there's no need to hold back! I don't care if you overdo it! If you end up killing me, then I will be satisfied nonetheless!"//to be rechecked, If you end up killing me, then I will be satisfied nonetheless
<Page14>
There's no time for pretense.
I take my gaze off Arcueid and stare at the enemy on the other side.
As if she was responding to my order, the girl from behind me says,
<Page15>
"Yeah, leave it to me! I'll make sure that you win, Shiki!"
