"Ha, ha―――!"
As I leave the building, I see a pile of debris in front of me.
I crouch down and advance forward, stopping just before the collapsed surface.

The pit is now 40 meters deep.
This area used to be a park.
But now there's no trace of it anymore.
The rubble forms a slope that leads to the ground below.
Although it'd be impossible to climb up from the bottom, I should be able to slide down even with legs like mine.
With that said―――
C:>I should go down.
C:>I should observe the situation.
