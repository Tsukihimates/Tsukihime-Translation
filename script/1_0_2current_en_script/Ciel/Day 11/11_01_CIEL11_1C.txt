Despite my expectations, all of my classes ended without any real benefit.
"It's no wonder school is boring."
So my friend was right when he said that at lunchtime.
<Page2>
On my way to the main gate, I turned towards the schoolyard on a whim.
There was no one on the field.
Club activities were banned and it was past dismissal time, so there were no students left in the school.
<Page3>
The sun is setting on the distant horizon.
I am the only one who likes to stay at school with nothing to do.
<Page4>
The school building is turning red.
I don't like to see the sunset.
It looks like blood sticking on the floor and makes me think back to the events of the past few days.
<Page5>
Something red. Red streets. A red processing plant.
A carpet made of human flesh, laid out on the stone chapel.
That feeling of stepping on fresh snow is quite addictive.
<Page6>
"It hurts ――――."
The pain from my eyeballs almost knocked me unconscious.
My head hurts even though I'm wearing my glasses.
<Page7>
              Why.
Why.              My head.
       Why.
                   My head.
   Why.
                       Why.
             Why.
<Page8>
"Haha ―――― haha ―――― ―――――"
The pain subsided soon after.
Thank God it's an unpopular time.
If someone, anyone, had been near me, that would have been enough to make me feel better, but no one was near me, thank God.
<Page9>
"Let's go home. I don't have any business here."
I sighed, letting out a lungful of air.
I left the red schoolyard, clutching my hand to my thirsty throat.
<Page10>
I dragged my limp body back home.
Since this morning, the sluggishness in my limbs has not gone away.
I need a radical solution.
I need to find a solution as soon as possible, as early as tonight.
<Page11>
"I'm home. ...... Hey, Hisui?"
Hisui is working on something in the lobby.
She is carrying an unfamiliar chair into the lobby, perhaps to redecorate.
<Page12>
She has noticed me, and comes towards me, trotting in quietly.
It reminds me of a small bird that approaches you without any sense of danger.
It's so defenseless that it makes me sigh. It's a good thing that I'm a moderate person, but if I were a mindless hunter, I'd have shot it down by now.
<Page13>
"Welcome home, Shiki-sama.
...... I'm sorry I didn't notice you were back."
...... It's getting worse. I don't want to see that sickly white neck of yours.
<Page14>
"That's okay. It happens once in a while. What's going on, redecoration?
"Yes. The chairs in the playroom have been replaced with new ones, so Akiha-sama asked me to move the old ones to a room with fewer chairs.
<Page15>
"I see. Is Kohaku-san here?
"She's just outside. If you need us, we can come to your room later. ......"
<Page16>
"No, that's okay. I can do it myself.
I'm thirsty, can I use the tea set in the dining room?
"Oh ...... yes.
The one on the tray should be fine.
<Page17>
"I see. I'm sorry for stopping you while you were working."
I'll see you later, I said and headed for the cafeteria.
<Page18>
I quench my thirst and return to the lobby.
There was a set of green tea and a light tea snack on the tray, so it took more time to finish than I expected.
Well.
My housemates haven't come home yet, so I have to stay in my room until dinner.
<Page19>
"Ouch!"
I felt a pain in my knee and looked down to find the chair that Hisui had just carried in.
<Page20>
The chair was placed against the wall so that it would not get in someone's way.
If I had paid attention, I wouldn't have bumped into it.
"...... Oh man. Am I so tired that I didn't even notice this?
I sigh.
<Page21>
There's no point in putting a chair in the lobby.
There are too many chairs in the lobby. What's the use of having so many of them? Why can't you see that this many of them are an eyesore? You have no sense at all. No modesty. They don't have any use.
<Page22>
...... Shit. The knee I hit on the chair still hurts.
This is extra pain.
It's a feeling I wouldn't have had to experience if it weren't for the chair.
It stings.
All this free time ruined by the mismanagement of one maid...
<Page23>
I kicked the chair.
A thud.
My leg hurts even more because of the kick.
Stupid,# Stupid,# Stupid,# Stupid,# Stupid.
"...this thing."
What a nuisance.
<Page24>
It's hurting my nerves.
This chair is an eyesore.
This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.# This chair.
<Page25>
"Shiki-sama, ......!"
"―――Hey, Hisui.
What's the matter, why are you here all of a sudden."
<Page26>
I said, surprised.
My breathing is all over the place. My throat is wheezing.
I look like I've been running a marathon for tens of kilometres.
<Page 27>
"Ah ...... Why am I breathing so hard, I wonder?
I raise my chin to improve my breathing.
<Page28>
"Shiki-sama...what are you talking about?"
<Page29>
"What do you mean? what's wrong with you Hisui, you look so anxious. What's wrong?"
"...... Shiki, don't you know what you've been doing ......?"
"What I've been doing? I'm not doing...
<Page30>
"Damn...
I have a headache again. I twist my head to shake it off and I notice an object at my feet.
There is a chair,
There are the remains of a smashed chair, scattered about.
<Page31>
"―――――― What?"
Thump, thump.
My heart is beating fast.
<Page32>
"Did I ...... do that?"
"...... Yes. It's the result of you taking the chair and repeatedly smashing it on the floor.
"Wha..."
<Page33>
I thought my heart is going to stop.
My body temperature is dropping rapidly.
The inside of my head is freezing with a sound.
I look down at my hands in dismay. There is definitely a mark at where I had gripped the leg of the chair.
<Page34>
"What?"
I don't know what it means.
I can't grasp the action.
This isn't like me.
Of course I bumped my foot on the chair and it hurt. But why did I break it in such a childish, petty rage over something like that? ......?
<Page35>
"Shiki-sama, are you not feeling well?
If you're not feeling well, I can call a doctor for you."
"......"
I know that look.
I've seen those eyes many times in the past at the hospital.
Those are the eyes that stare at me, Tohno Shiki, as if I were foreign object.
<Page 36>
"No... It's nothing. It's nothing.
I'm sorry Hisui, I'm sorry ...... I'm out of my mind."
I pull away from the little bird.
Away from the broken, dismembered chair that I destroyed by my hands.
<Page37>
"Shiki-sama, please calm down.
It's not good for your health if you breathe so hard.
"It's okay, just leave me alone!
I just want to be alone. Let me be alone. ......!
<Page38>
I run up the stairs yelling.
It's as if i'm running away, I think to myself.
