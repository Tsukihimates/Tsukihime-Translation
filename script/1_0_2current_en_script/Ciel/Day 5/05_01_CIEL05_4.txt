<Page1>
I run while keeping my attention on Vlov.
Ciel-senpai is at the edge of the crater, having been sent flying away on an even taller pile of debris.
<Page2>
"Senpai...! Pull yourself together, Senpai!"
I rush over and call out to her.
She's covered with bruises, but I don't see any significant bleeding.
The armor-like thing has come off, leaving her chest unprotected.
<Page3>
Her chest, that until now didn't even show the slightest sign of movement, convulses and trembles after I call out to her.
Thank God, Senpai is still alive...!
<Page4>
"Can you hear me!? I know it must hurt, but you have to stand up, Ciel-senpai!"
"Ugh... A few minu... mor... Nhnn?"
<Page5>
While looking after Senpai, I catch sight of him at the edge of my vision.
————This is bad.
The vampire had never moved before, but now, very slowly but steadily, one step at a time, he is advancing towards us.
<Page6>
The large spear that sent Senpai flying away till here has crumbled. He's now holding a spear one size smaller.
His left hand, that I cut off in the underground, has come back, but he hasn't used it for some time. It's probably because just the outside was restored. His left hand is functionally dead.
<Page7>
From what I mentioned earlier, he doesn't have much strength left.
That's exactly why he forced his body to march, to finish off his cornered prey.
<Page8>
"Tohno...kun?"
"Senpai...! Thank God, you're aware! We'll talk later, but you have to get up quickly! Vlov is coming!"
<Page9>
"Ah... Yes, thank you very mu...# Wait, Tohno-kun!?"
A dream!? I'm not dreaming, am I!? Are you really so stupid!? Why did you actually come!? After I asked you so much to go home!?"
<Page10>
Senpai, still sprawled on the pile of debris, looks at me with surprise.
It's understandable that she's angry, but now's not the time for that.
<Page11>
"You'll be angry later! Aaah enough, I'll pull you, okay!?
—————W-Woah, you're heav—!? Senpai, aren't you incredibly heavy!?"
<Page12>
"It's just you who's not strong, I'm just slightly above average!# Enough, just run away now! This doesn't concern you. If you go now, you should still be able to make it!"
<Page13>
Ciel-senpai wriggles to swat away the hand gripping her.
Her advice was given out of concern for me, and...
"...If I run away, will I be saved?"
I ask, filled with all the emotions I had in me.
<Page14>
"........."
Right. It would be a lie to say that I'd be saved if I escaped.
The choice of running away itself carries <responsibility|s a c r i f i c e   >.
In the first place, running away from here will only spare me temporarily. 
As long as that vampire isn't brought down right here, whatever is done will be too late.
<Page15>
"—————Tohno-kun, that's"
"That's how it is, Senpai. Running away won't solve anything. We have no choice but to fight.
...Like when you fought for everyone's sake earlier,"
Or like that night.
When she told me that 'I could find salvation'. 
"If I really want to be saved, then I have to kill him here, however scared I am."
<Page16>
... I mean, that's the only thing I can do.
Put simply, killing is all I'm able to do.
That's fine too. Even if I'll have to atone for the fact that I'm a murderer, that this fight doesn't concern me, this is fine.
...Even if this only proves that I am a killing monster. 
If I'm able to kill the negative temperatures coming from behind, then I'll gladly, once more, get closer and strike at his weak point.
<Page17>
"Anyway, leave it to me! Let me fight with you, Senpai!"
"C-Certainly, you did cut down Vlov's arm but...# N-No, no! There's no reason to! There's no reason to go that far!"
<Page18>
The reason she speaks of isn't about me, she's talking about a reason that she needs to exploit me.
————How virtuous of her.
Even in this situation, she's trying to protect the good-for-nothing I am. 
<Page19>
"In that case, reward me!
If I assist you in defeating him, then, then———"
<Page20>
Shit, I can't immediately come up with a relevant compensation.
A reward? I can only think of what's in front of me now. 
Honestly, I've been incredibly aroused for quite a while. It's not surprising that a healthy boy like me feels desire when presented with such a succulent body.
<Page21>
Thinking of what I'd to do to that body, I can come up with a lot of things. But that would definitely destroy everything. Everything would be ruined. In the first place, I'll have one go, and it'll be over.//I'm not sure I correctly understand そもそもワンパンでおしまいだ
In that case, how about something more restrained like exchanging emails? Or a friend request? What am I thinking, it's so dumb, I can do that whenever I want, it's completely stupid, it's absolutely idiotic! But strangely I find myself smiling, yes, it's definitely better than finding an important reason or whatever. I love her. I'm here because I couldn't leave her alone. That's why even though Vlov is approaching, I don't find anything strange in thinking about 'what's next' for me and Senpai...//The JP line is already at the limit of the screen, so there's a good chance the EN text overflows?
<Page22>
"I've decided! Next, I want a bite of Senpai's bento! With that, we'll have an agreement! Ah, of course hand-made!"
"Ha... haa!? B-B-B-But there's only one thing I can make!" 
"Hmm, then that one! It's nice to have a dish you really like!"
<Page23>
There's no clear plan and no effective clever scheme.
I'm talking fast because I know there's not much time left.
<Page24>
I turn my eyes away from Senpai et focus on the vampire.
From here on, I'll just use my eyes for her sake.
...As I make up my mind, my hand, trembling from nervousness, is grabbed from behind.
<Page25>
"—————Senpai?"
"...Two things that you must absolutely keep in mind. Don't stand directly in front of him. Concentrate on getting behind him."
"Understood. And the second thing?"
<Page26>
"I don't want you to think about me, whatever may happen to me. You've already seen it, but I'm as tough as iron."
<Page27>
There was a hint of embarrassment and self-derision in her voice.
...My warm fluttering emotions vanish.
I berate myself for having said such things to Senpai.
Nodding, I let go of her hand. I already miss her soft touch.
<Page28>
I move away from Senpai.
I face the approaching vampire coming from the other side.
The massacre at the hotel. The hell of the catacombs.
Recalling those scenes, I stop thinking about the reasons that pushed to such a fight to the death.
<Page29>
My body will be able to operate at a satisfactory level for one minute at most.
In the meantime, I will discard all human-like emotions. 
I will leave behind both fear and exaltation. 
————From now on.
    I have become a machine that solely sees death.//Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds
<Page30>
I think anew.
The radiance of an unyielding life is just like that of a twinkling star.
<Page31>
...For the first time, I meet his gaze.
Vlov is paying attention to me.
During the battle underground, he understood that I was 'a weak but dangerous poison'. He is thus not ignoring me. 
Suddenly, I feel a human-like hope that a dialogue may now be possible.
<Page32>
But mutual understanding is not needed.
I don't see him as a living being.
Similarly, he only sees me as an object.
We can't be on more even footing. 
We already understand each other plenty.
<Page33>
I run across the barely forty meters separating us. 
Our last tryst was all too short.
Four seconds. The instant of two breaths.  
<Page34>
The ice blocks he shoots ignore me and pass by.
Exactly. Rather than caring about me closing in, he chose to finish off Senpai as she was exhausted.
<Page35>
————I don't look back.
I don't have that luxury. Gritting my teeth, I advance further towards him.
<Page36>
Knife and spear.
The range of those weapons can't even be compared. 
If I want to cut his lines, I'll have to slip through this first.
<Page37>
A blow dealt with a physical strength far above that of humans.
There's no way I can evade it. 
I don't know how, but that guy is no longer the vampire I knew. 
<Page38>
Light has come back to his eyes. His sword tells of his rationality and experience. The dullness that relied only on overflowing brute force has left his body.
In other words.
Here is simply a living creature desperately fighting for its survival, the same as me. 
<Page39>
"'——————!'"
Of course.
The blow, that was about to pierce my heart, is deflected by another one coming from behind me.
<Page40>
If we were single-function organisms, then she was a composite body of talents.
Having put my faith in her, I instinctively knew.
In terms of specs, that girl is ahead of us, even put together.
<Page41>
And then, the one-minute climax begun.
The vampire and the girl, exchanging blows head-on.
The small-bodied thorn going around the back.
The knight moves about while keeping his two opponents in his field of vision and without ever exposing his back.
<Page42>
A dancing interplay of blades.
Like a symphony played with the most superb of techniques.
The revolving guillotine-blade. The strike of a knife slipping through its gaps. The ice spears, simultaneously brushing them off and precisely striking the weak point of their <coordination|p i a n o  f o u r  h a n d s>.//Musical metaphor, 弾く also means playing the piano
<Page43>
'Ugh—————, ah————...!'
However improvised this is, we are working in sync. 
She is moving so that I can stay in her shadow.
I am gliding so as not to be inside her movement range. 
<Page44>
A neck nad neck battle.
The voltage rises without end.
The focus heightens every passing second. 
For me, killing the enemy means I have to keep looking at him.
<Page45>
How dazzling.
I've never once until now kept looking at one single 'death'.
—————As a result
<Page46>
I <see the light|u n d e r s t a n d  h i s  p r i n c i p l e>
A thing that can never be understood.
I see the light of something that should not be seen by a form of thought that constructs theories with language and record-keeping. 
Death is most fundamental basis common to all of creation.
With that as its extreme point, here lies the focal point of perception.
<Page47>
It was the memory of a snow field.
It was the memory of persecution.
It was the memory of being drift.
It was the memory of salvation.
It was the memory of treason.
It was, in other words, the finality of a knight.
<Page48>
He was falsely accused and forced to leave his country. He lost his homeland to political scheming. 
He was exiled to this corner of the world.
It was an uninhabitable sea of freezing cold.
Left behind in this most distant of seas, he had no choice but to continue living.
There was only the cold.
There was only the pain.
What saved him from complete decay was a woman, like a rotting tree, who had run away from humans and <Dead Apostles|h e r  f e l l o w s>
<Page49>
There was a brief spring.
He loved the flowers blooming in the snowfield, loved the birds, and killed people as if to sing. 
He also acquired ten wives to console him. 
His loyalty to his lord was like a ice wall that would never melt.
<Page50>
However, the pain carved into his soul could never be healed.
He could not resist the dryness they call 'coldness'.
He abandoned being a knight in order to escape the cold.
Even though he was kidnapped.
His only sunshine, he put it off with his own hands.
<Page51>
That is what this man is.
That is the vampire who received the name of Vlov.
His whole being is coldness and treason, drift and regret.
<Page52>
Ahhh————If so, then I can kill him.
If I can put into words what his principle is, then it is in the realm of humans.
Rejoice, vampire.
Right now, I can completely and utterly kill you.
<Page53>
The inner sea of the planet, the canopy covering the sky applauds.
Curse upon the Ancestors.
Curse upon the world of Man. 
The principle has not yet taken hold. This planet's foundation is far too brittle. 
<Page54>
"'—————————You'"
My skins is burned by his flame-like bloodlust.
My consciousness, that was about to connect, returns.//Connect to what? I suppose to what was 'speaking' the previous page, but is also left vague.
<Page55>
"'What did you look at, my...!!!!!!!!!!!'"//Eleven !
"Tohno-kun, get down...!"
<Page56>
I hear a voice.
I don't even have the strength to turn my gaze.
What a blunder. I was far too entranced. The lack of oxygen is making me dizzy.
Not only am I not able to look over to Senpai, but I can't even properly block the spear coming in right in front of me...!
