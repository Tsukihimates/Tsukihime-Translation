<Page1>
...This is awkward.
Even though I couldn't do anything about it, she still perfectly saw Noel-sensei and I embracing each other.
<Page2>
"Um... Senpai, this is..."
"Noel-sensei, go contact the local Church branch.
I want to declare an Urban Suppression Action, will that be possible?" 
<Page3>
"Mmm, it should be, but isn't that meaningless? There aren't many Executors available in this area after all.# You'll get permission, but expecting an increase in our fighting strength is hopeless. When push comes to shove, the two of us will be on our own."
<Page4>
"...I see. In that case, please arrange for restrictions on freedom of information and on police organizations. You have the network for that, don't you, Sensei?"
<Page5>
"Yes yes, leave it to me ♪. I don't want to be in such a dangerous place, so I'll quickly go do the formalities!
Bye-bye Shiki-kun! You're so cute when you're blushing ♪."
<Page6>
Looking very amused by something, Noel-sensei waves her hand, making a whooshing sound as she jumps away.
...Truly, she's jumping, hop hop, on the slanted mountain of debris.
<Page7>
"――――――"
On the other hand, Senpai brushes away the dust on her uniform, looking tight-lipped and bored.
<Page8>
...Senpai is actually the one acting more oddly here.
I think I have the right to ask her who exactly she is.
<Page9>
"........."
...But, I don't know what I should say.
<Page10>
Something like, 'Who exactly are you?'
Or, 'Are you injured?'
Or, 'What are you going to do from now on?"
Or, 'Nothing happened between me and Sensei'
I couldn't speak out any of these common phrases.
<Page11>
Looking at the sky, dusk is coming to an end.
The sun will completely set very soon.
Moving back from the nearby department store, the section that collapsed includes the central park.
<Page12>
A rubble-filled crater. Who would have thought that there would be such a large space under the park?
<Page13>
Looking up at the surface, I can already see barricade-like things being installed.
Even though there has been a cave-in, there are no onlookers. This is how big of a catastrophe this is. There should have been at the very least one or two news helicopters flying above, but there are none.
<Page14>
"There isn't anything to cover. This is purely an accident. We're also evacuating neighboring residents under the pretext of an underground gas explosion.
...The only people who are prepared concerning what happens next are me, the policemen who have cordoned off the area, and you."//Fix this, I didn't understand the original sentence
<Page15>
"...I see. What about the underground pathways?#"
"Crushed when everything collapsed. They'll surely find some remains, but they'll probably just pretend there never was anything."
"...Is that what you and your group are pushing for?"
<Page16>
"No. This is entirely a decision made by this country's police. They too will probably investigate why there was a cave down here. But that will be all. After all, who would imagine this was the work of a monster who collected corpses and drained them of their blood?
Once the dozens of bodies that seem to correspond to missing people are found, that will be the end."
<Page17>
I could only simply acquiesce to Senpai's explanation.
I understand that this is a matter that cannot be handed to regular justice, but still, I can't stand it.
<Page18>
So many dead men and women.
So many human sacrifices who will be buried in darkness, without knowing why they were killed.//ruby dots <な|・><ぜ|・><殺|・><さ|・><れ|・><た|・><の|・><か|・><も|・>
<Page19>
"...At any rate, I have to give thanks.
So thank you, Senpai. If you weren't here, I would have been one of the casualties too."
<Page20>
"...Ohhh, mhmmm.
It's good that you're safe, Tohno-kun."
<Page21>
"―――W-Wait, more importantly!
This isn't the time for idle talk!"
<Page22>
"Let me be frank. It would be inconvenient for you, a normal human, to be involved any further. I hope that you'll wisely decide to keep this matter under wraps.
...That being said, this isn't something that you can just forget.
That's why, for your own safety, I will be erasing your memories of the past day. So please don't resist."
<Page23>
"Urgh...!?"
Senpai approaches with a serious expression on her face.
<Page24>
"Erasing memories... You can do something like that!?"
<Page25>
"Yes. Even I can erase one day worth of memories. That way, you'll go back to your normal life from before yesterday.
But it'll hurt a bit, so I won't mind if you resent me."
<Page26>
Senpai briskly comes closer.
"W-Wait, it doesn't make sense!? I mean, you're erasing my memories!? Resenting you would be pointless!?"
I panic and step back.
<Page27>
"...Yes. You'll forget that too, but I just wanted to say it properly beforehand."
Senpai walks up to me undeterred.
<Page28>
"Now please close your eyes.
I think it will be twice, no, ten times more painful if you're looking."
<Page29>
"W-Wai―――"
I couldn't get my head around what's about to happen.
But nevertheless―――be that as it may, forgetting what happened today is the one thing I can't allow.
<Page30>
After all, Vlov is still alive.
I have to do something about him.
<Page31>
...If I could erase my memories, I would as well.
But, that's only for after everything is over.
There's no way I can just escape to my personal safety bubble, without knowing anything. 
<Page32>
"P-Please wait, Senpai...!"
Uhh, your real identity and vampires and the like, that's what you want me to keep secret right!? Then, do it tomorrow please!
Today is―――"
<Page33>
I can't pretend nothing happened.
After experiencing that underground graveyard, to be the only one returning to normal life... absolutely not.
<Page34>
".........You would't do something dangerous, right?"
"Uh, yeah. I won't. I never did."
"..........."
<Page35>
...If needed, I'm very seriously ready to resist.
As if reading my thoughts, Senpai stares at me right in the eyes.
<Page36>
Holding my breath, I stare back undaunted at Senpai.
The silence must have been a few seconds for her.
But to me, it lasted for what felt like minutes. And then.
<Page37>
"...I understand. I trust you, Tohno-kun.
After what you experienced there earlier, I don't think you'll do anything rash... And even though it's unnecessary, I still owe for saving me once."
<Page38>
Senpai says and turns back.
Like Noel-sensei, she walks on the slanted mountain of rubble without a care.
<Page39>
"――――――"
Before I could feel relieved, a feeling of uneasiness crosses my mind. 
I could see Senpai with her back to me, and somehow, she looks incredibly lonely.
<Page40>
"Senpai...!"
I call out to her instinctively.
<Page41>
"What is it?"
"...Umm. Senpai, did you come to this city to kill vampires?"
<Page42>
"It turns out to be the case. I'm not originally from this city. I enrolled at your school as a student for the purpose of killing that vampire. When everything is over, I'll leave this city."
<Page43>
"Once that happens, I've decided that I will purge your memories.
Until then, I'll let you off the hook. Please refrain earnestly from dangerous activities.# If I see you, I fully intend to deal with you as a hindrance."
<Page44>
With a level-headed gaze and a cold voice, Senpai warns me.
Go home.
There's no need to put your life in danger any further.
<Page45>
"...I understand. But, Senpai, you won't do something dangerous right...? Like fighting that vampire alone."
<Page46>
"No way. Fighting something like him alone is impossible.
In a few days, reinforcement will arrive. Until then, I'll simply monitor this place. Please go back where you belong and don't worry." 
<Page47>
With that, she disappears promptly from my sight.
The sun will sink under the horizon soon.
The time for vampires to―――
The time for battle is fast approaching.
<Page48>
"...Really.
Even I know that was a lie just now, Senpai."
<Page49>
...She's ready to fight, even alone.
In that case, I still have something I must do.
I'll report back to Arcueid what happened up to now.
If she learns that Vlov is buried underground, even she may change her mind.
