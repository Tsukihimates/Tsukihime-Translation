'We'll wait until your strength is restored.'
Relieved by this plan, Arcueid soon fell asleep.
<Page2>
I watched her until I was sure she was sleeping and walked out of the apartment.//見届けて
My destination is obvious.
It's the department store in front of the station where Vlov's stronghold is.
<Page3>
The area in front of the station is no different than usual.
Advertisement and goods are lined up along the colorful department store street. People come and go, sparing a glance at the shop windows.
In the middle of it, is a large department store that I'm familiar with.
<Page4>
It's one of the biggest department stores in the city.
Even now, a large number of people come in and out of the department store which has become the embodiment of Souya Station. Is this really where...?
<Page5>
"...This place is a prime spot in front of the station.
There's not the slightest sign of a vampire in sight..."
<Page6>
But I don't think Arcueid was lying.
She's got no common sense, but her judgment and information are accurate.
It may be precisely because she's not bound by common sense that she arrived at this improbable conclusion.//有り得ない事実
<Page7>
"Come to think of it... Arihiko did say that strange stuff was happening around the north gate..."
<Page8>
'There is a part-time job that anyone can do and it pays well.'
It's an urban legend with no credibility, a childish lure.
If it persisted on the internet, neither disappearing nor flamboyantly spreading, it may be because it's not totally a lie.
<Page9>
There's no one who can testify to the details of this part-time job. It's also unclear whether anyone has actually experienced it.
Nevertheless, rumors about this part-time job continue to circulate.
The number of people receiving these messages is unspecified, but they are continually sent out.
<Page10>
...In other words, this means that regardless of the authenticity of the content, there's someone out there who needs outsiders.
<Page11>
As it turns out, there's nothing unusual about the department store.
From the grocery store in the basement to the specialty stores on the seventh floor, it's an ordinary department store.
But...
<Page12>
"...There isn't anything above the seventh floor. Considering the size of this department store, it should have at least ten floors..."
<Page13>
The elevator only has buttons to go up to the seventh floor, and the stairs has a sign saying that the seventh floor is off-limits.//Seventh or eighth?
<Page14>
Aiming for a moment when no one is around, I climb the stairs through the no-entry rope.
The stairs lead up to the upper floors, but I'm blocked.
The part leading to the eighth floor has shutters down as expected.
Next to it, there is a locked emergency door.
<Page15>
"...If there's anything here, it's this way..."
I ponder whether to go inside or to return back.
<Page16>
I know I'm going to do something reckless.
I'll be entering that monster's hideout alone.
I know very well,
how crazy such a move is.//I've inverted 53 and 54 
<Page17>
"...It's okay. I should be able to do it."
I clutch the knife hidden in my pocket.
I've got these eyes if it comes down to it.
<Page18>
I thought about running to the police and explaining the situation. It's the safest thing to do.
But what would that achieve? In the first place, I'm going to kill him. How is a killer asking the police for help going to persuade anyone? To begin with, we probably don't share the same goal.
<Page19>
"...I'll check things first.
If things get out of hand, I can go back to Arcueid's room..."
<Page20>
I take off my glasses and 'kill' the lock on the emergency door.
I nervously swallow, feeling the saliva go down my numbed throat.
After taking a deep breath to calm myself down, I slide to the floor where the lights had gone out.
<Page21>
Inside the eighth floor, it's all dark.
It's only natural considering that the lights are off, but it's still very unexpected.
It is daytime. Even if the power is off, the floor should still be bright from the sunlight coming through the windows.
<Page22>
However, in fact, each and every window is blocked from the inside with something that looks like an iron plate.
This is too much for anti-theft measures.
The iron plates are attached with bolts and cannot be removed by human effort alone. Even the small window of the bathroom has a plate attached to it.//人の力
<Page23>
It's like a pathological obsession. And yet, the work is messy.
The size of the steel plate doesn't quite match the size of the window, so there's still sunlight passing through the tiny gaps.
<Page24>
I can only see it as a move to prevent someone inside from escaping... rather than to keep intruders from entering.
<Page25>
Or―――am I just overthinking and this is just a sunshade?//Sunshade in italics, ruby dots <日|・><除|・><け|・>
If so...
<Page26>
"...Isn't this place... too clean?"
Even though there's dust everywhere in the hallway, there's no foul smell nor strange bodies to be found.
<Page27>
Then this must be a floor under renovation.
I don't see anything that would be similar to the disaster that happened at the hotel.
<Page28>
"The ninth floor is clean, too... I wonder if Arcueid misunderstood something..."
<Page29>
I slightly release the tension in my nerves.
I go up to the tenth floor, not realizing that even that slight slip is fatal.
And then, at that moment...
<Page30>
"Haaa? Who the hell are you, and what are you doing, entering people's house like that?"
<Page31>
I brace myself at the sudden sound of someone speaking.
At the top of the stairs, a duo with flashlights is standing at the entrance.//二人組, translated as 'duo' to be consistent with 05_00_ARC05_3_1
<Page32>
"........."
I observe them, squinting into the light.
They are both male, not much older than me.
They only have flashlights in their hands, no long-handed tools like bats or pipes.
<Page33>
"Hey, why aren't you talking? Are you aware that you're doing something wrong? What's with this guy, isn't he lame? He's clearly scared, right? He's a totally different breed from us, yeah? Hey Toshi, do you know this guy with glasses?"
<Page34>
"Nah, no way. If I knew such a nerd, I would've died of embarrassment.//Original was otaku
Hey, you there, come over here, okay? If you run away, you'll get hurt badly, you get it? Or should I just kill him? The law says I can kill you for trespassing!"
<Page35>
The duo laughs but doesn't move away from where they stand... in front of the elevator.
'Don't run away' they said, but I didn't even consider fleeing through the stairs.
<Page36>
"What's with the lack of response? Aren't you going to run away? It's normal to run away in this situation. Toshi, isn't there something fishy about this guy?"
"Your face is so nasty, the shock was too much for that four-eyes... Hey, that's it, right? You were just confused huh? Why are you playing around in an area that's off-limits?"//Is four-eyes okay to use in this situation?
"........"
In the darkness, I thought I saw a dull glint in the eyes of the duo.
<Page37>
"........."
What do I do?
Should I run away or try to talk to them?
Is this really the den of that vampire in the first place?
Can I check that with these two guys?//ruby dots <確|・><認|・><し|・><て|・>
<Page38>
"Ohh, could it be our lucky day?//ボーナスタイム
Hey Toshi, I'm sure you said that we could do whatever we want with those who don't have an appointment!"
<Page39>
"Shut up, Haru. Stay quiet for one minute.
So what is it going to be, nerd? Was it just on a whim?"
"........"
<Page40>
I'll obtain information to grasp the situation,//I think it's the meaning of the 情報と+comma
while keeping an eye on the duo's movements.//shifted the punctuations
<Page41>
"...I'm sorry. I heard that you can get a part-time job here..."
I said in a meek voice while looking closely at the man named Toshi.
<Page42>
"...A part-time job, huh? Where did you hear about it? It's been I've only been talking about it to a bunch of stupid girls lately."
"I got to know it by hearsay. That you could get a lot of money by spending the night of the apartment at the north gate."
