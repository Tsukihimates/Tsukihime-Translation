"Ugh―――!"
I restrain my urge to run over to Senpai, and look back to Noel-sensei.
<Page2>
I tell myself that I made a choice. I decided that I would do what is feasible to me.
Even if I rushed over to Senpai, I would just be caught in the explosion.
<Page3>
"Noel-sensei...!"
I hold in my arms Noel-sensei, who lies unconscious on the floor.
If I leave her like that, she'll be buried alive.
<Page4>
"Haa... haa, ha...!"
Gasping for air, I dash to one of the pathways.
As a rough estimate, there are still 20 meters to go.
The collapse of the cavity is by now inevitable.
I push to the back of my mind the thought that I would have made it alone.
<Page5>
Carrying Noel-sensei, I get out of the room, just like Senpai told me to.
<Page6>
"――――――Aaah"
―――That.
Is what I so arrogantly thought,
without even having the time to have any regrets.
<Page7>
That last vain struggle is truly pointless.
I bring Noel-sensei down my back and lay her on the ground. I embrace her and brace for the unavoidable mass about to fall on us.
<Page8>
Sand and debris fall down all around.
Without offering resistance, in a mere instant, Tohno Shiki disappears from this world.
