"It's..."
Obvious that I'll help Senpai...!
<Page2>
I run feverishly after her.
It's at night that vampires can make use of their full power.
If I have to defeat him, it has to be during daytime, right now.
In order to avoid any more sacrifices like last night at the hotel, Senpai heads towards Vlov, fully aware that she's at a disadvantage.
<Page3>
Then, there's no way I would run away.
I'm still unhurt, I don't have a headache, and I have stamina to spare.
<Page4>
If I can just get close to Vlov one more time,
even if I can't kill him,
I should at least be of some help to Senpai―――!
<Page5>
"You're in the way―――"
At this point, one or two zombies are nothing to be afraid of.
I ready my knife to cut the 'lines' of the Dead that stand in my way.
Before I could close the distance, they explode in a chain reaction.
<Page6>
Such nonsense.
Even after all the warnings Arcueid gave me, I still don't understand him.
From the beginning, he never had the slightest intention to 'fight a human'.
<Page7>
"―――Tohno-kun, no...!"
Her dissuasive words don't reach me in time.
...My desire to help just caused her trouble.
In the middle of the huge falling mass of earth and sand, Senpai's words are the last thing I hear.
