"Ugh―――, haa...!"
Suddenly, there are 20 meters separating us.
It seems that Senpai, holding me from my back, kept me away from Vlov.
<Page2>
I can't even catch a breath.
His bloodlust reaches me even from there.
Killing me is now the only thought in the vampire's mind.
<Page3>
"Senpai, please, let me go."
I raise my voice without turning around.
She releases the arms that are holding me at the waist.
Behind me, I could hear the sound of something heavy being lifted up.
<Page4>
"We're both at our limit then.
Are you aware of the state of your body?"
"Yes. My right arm is the only thing I can still move."
<Page5>
The pain in my eyes is beyond description.
As if balls of fire are inserted in my eye sockets.
At this rate, my brain will shut down from the pain in my head before I stop breathing.
<Page6>
"I see. Then, can I still have faith?"//ruby dots <ま|・><だ|・><信|・><じ|・><て|・>
"――――――Of course. This is where the main part begins."
I unconsciously nod while smiling.//I'm not sure if it's Shiki or Ciel doing the action
I feel a slight pang in my chest.
No matter what the situation may be, I rediscove how gratifying it is to have someone understand what I'm feeling.
<Page7>
"―――Good. Let's go, Senpai."
"Leave it to me. Straight ahead, do what you can."
<Page8>
I didn't have the strength to go around.
I break into a straight-line sprint, and Senpai follows after me a second afterwards.
<Page9>
Ice spears pouring down like raindrops.
The spears are all aimed at me. To Vlov, <this thing|I    > is already the greater threat.//I've modified the sentence a little, I hope the "I" as ruby doesn't look too strange, ruby dots <そ|・><う|・><い|・><う|・><モ|・><ノ|・>
<Page10>
But they don't hit.
With an ear-splitting sound of a gunshot, Senpai's bullets are literally turning the ice spears into rain.
She didn't retreat without a reason.
That's also why she jumped there before, so that she could pick up the gun that was flung away.
<Page11>
One instant.
Just one more instant, and I'll cut this light.
Obviously, as things are, this is wishful thinking.
He, too, is putting his heart and soul. No matter how weakened, his physical abilities are far higher than mine.
Tohno Shiki alone cannot withstand this spear's strike.
<Page12>
That's why I'm risking my life to help her.
What does he give priority to?
Me, running on the ground, or the executor covering me from above?
In a split-second decision, he realize that Senpai is the danger. That she is the one to kill him.
However―――
<Page13>
However, rejecting all of his intuition, he goes for me who is creeping on the ground.
It isn't brushed away by intense emotions. He bends by sheer willpower the absolute command that intuition represents.
<Page14>
This isn't the vampire who was buried in his persecution complex. This is a lone knight. How much willpower does he even possess to ignore the true desire of his heart?
Anger and such are too feeble. It is his obsession, for which he risk his entire existence, his pride that made him choose to kill me.
<Page15>
Ahhh―――How beautiful, but how foolish.
That's why you came, all alone, to such a foreign country.
<Page16>
"Shackles are broken, bones are removed, grudges are borne―――"
<Page17>
The inescapable arm of iron is swung down.
In this climax, she is no exception.
She is also putting her heart and soul.
As if to show me the way,
<Page18>
"By the distant howl, may ten thousand miles come to naught―――!" 
The arm forms a rift in the ground and smashes half of his body.
<Page19>
The tip of his spear wavers from the impact.
Just a few millimeters more and my head wouldn't be attached to the rest of my body anymore.
The block of ice lands on my left shoulder.
It's fine. Enduring the impact of the hit, I step forward.
<Page20>
Squelch.
The knife slide into the vampire's chest with ease.
<Page21>
"Raa―――aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
I fall to the ground and writhe around in excruciating pain.
My brain feels like it's burning.
It is as if the tip of the knife had become my finger.//I have no idea what the original line means
The pain, originating from the 'point' I stabbed, is transmitted through the knife and spreads to my whole body.
<Page22>
"―――You―――"
I vaguely understand through the intense pain jolting through my head.
Just now, I saw too deep.//saw too deep in italics., ruby dots <視|・><す|・><ぎ|・><た|・>
Instead of the vessel containing the vampire, I erased the burning fire.
I failed―――If I saw his death instead of that radiance, I would have definitely killed him―――!"
"―――What are you―――"
<Page23>
The vampire has been released from the curse scorching his body.
The man, who has returned to being a mere Dead Apostle, brandishes his claws.
<Page24>
"Vlov Arkhangel...!"
<Page25>
The serpentine sword mows them down.
The expanding and contracting large sword swallows down the vampire's body, like a literal snake.
<Page26>
The beheading sword whooshes as it rotates.
The tornado, that forms with the executor in its center, lifts the body of the vampire into the sky, and―――
<Page27>
"―――Life burns, and men sicken.
       Flesh and blood are feeble, and even wisdom melts.
       Whence salvation comes from the earth, and salvation from our homeland."
<Page28>
The iron blade changes form.
The sword settles down into the form of a pile-driver.
And assaults the falling vampire.
<Page29>
"―――Wait.
That baptism―――"
<Page30>
An inescapable death blow.
The vampire is struck by the impact, that shatters not only his ribs but also his whole torso, and extends his claws once more.
<Page31>
"You―――I see, you too...!
Everywhere, even here, that cunning serpent...!
Die. Die, die, die...!
You will never kill me...!"
<Page32>
This is a display of deep hatred that I have seen no traces of until now.
<Page33>
"Perish, vampire.
'A flower to my bosom―――^<Redemption by the Prayer of the Holy Maiden|     C r e a t u r e  d e l  C i e l o>!"//Creature del Cielo, in French 'Creature du Ciel', means Heavenly Creatures. Which is also the IT/EN name of a film whose JP name is 乙女の祈り. How strange.
<Page34>
"Aaaa―――aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!"
His death throes pierce the heavens.
Without forgiveness, nor compassion.
The stake becomes an iron hammer passing judgment upon the sinner, and erases from this earth all traces of the existence of the vampire.
