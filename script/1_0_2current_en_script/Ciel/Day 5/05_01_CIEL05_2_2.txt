<Page1>
"Ugh, haaa―――!"
I resume breathing. Oxygen is returning to my blood.
<Page2>
Don't forget. He's releasing waves of high temperature.//Added waves
Any normal living being would be mortally wounded just by approaching him.
I already experienced that once at the hotel...!
<Page3>
"...!"
But it's too late. A phosphorescent light shines by my ankles.
<Page4>
I lose sensation in my ankles.
'Jum...p!'
I try to jump sideways with all my might, but couldn't move.
<Page5>
The creaking in my ankles earlier is a sign that my end has come.
My entire body's abilities are weakening, not from an inflammation caused by the high temperature, but because of some unknown pain.
<Page6>
I look up. I see in front of me his blood-soaked coat.
The vampire's right arm swings down, aiming at my face.
―――I lost.
I can't do anything against such a simple attack. It isn't any faster than last time, but my body feels heavy. I can't move. I can't dodge. With this, the moment he grabs my head, I'll be crushed like a tomato―――
<Page7>
But.
The harvest of the human-fruit head known as Tohno Shiki is interrupted by an exploding bullet coming from the side.
<Page8>
That was a bullet... maybe even some sort of rocket.
I could only assume so. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to blow away that vampire like that, almost over 30 meters.
<Page9>
"Ugh...!"
Whatever that was, it saved me.
Without delay, I regain my bearings.
<Page10>
It's no use, my legs still feel heavy..!
I can't lift my shoes off the floor, as if they were heat activated adhesives.//Could be too technical a translation, open for alternatives for 熱で張り付いたように、床から靴が持ち上がらない。
My body isn't getting enough oxygen after all the strain I put on it.
I can't even move a single step.
<Page11>
On the other hand.
I could see the vampire standing up unperturbed after having been blown away, holding up his right arm.
<Page12>
"Ugh...!"
Now for sure, it's over.
Terrified of my impending death by fire, I unconsciously close my eyes.
<Page13>
......
.........
...............It's not... hot?
<Page14>
"―――Wha"
As I open my eyes, I see that female student standing there.
The flames unleashed by the vampires comes to a stop in front of her.
<Page15>
No, more precisely, they are repelled.
The flying tongue of flame is repelled by an invisible wall, reaching neither me nor her.//I chose "flying" for 噴出
<Page16>
"........"
The schoolgirl is unfazed by the flames in front of her.
I want to call out to her, but I couldn't leave Noel-sensei who collapsed.
<Page17>
"Wait, don't move. Noel-sensei is safe. As she is, she'll wake up."
I'm startled by her voice.
It wasn't on my mind earlier, but that voice―――
<Page18>
"Ciel-senpai...!?"
"...Haa, if possible, I would have wanted to keep it a secret until the very end."
<Page19>
The female student briskly puts on her glasses.
Just with that, the unfamiliar girl's presence completely changes.
<Page20>
...No, I just didn't look properly at her face. I think I just vaguely labeled her as 'an unfamiliar girl'.
<Page21>
"But why?! N-No, more than that, fire, fire!"
"'Why', I should be the one asking you... Anyway, now that it's come to this, that question doesn't even matter.
Did you hear about executors from that blonde-haired True Ancestor?"
"――――――"
<Page22>
...Executors.
Dispatched to kill vampires, they are the Church's heretics hunters.
That's who Ciel-senpai is...?
Then Noel-sensei too...?
<Page23>
Come to think of it, she also said that.
'Executors are, fundamentally, a two-man cell, one master and one disciple'...!
<Page24>
"It seems she told you. Good, you're quick on the uptake.
...Since that's the case, Tohno-kun, please don't move an inch. I'll take care of the rest instead of Sensei."
<Page25>
Ciel-senpai looks away from me and faces the vampire in the distance.
...I don't say anything to stop her.
I wanted to ask her 'why',
And I didn't think Senpai can defeat that monster.
...But, the fact that she just saved me forces my body still.
<Page26>
"...An executor? Like the dogs of the Church they are, it appears they have a good nose, but nothing more."
Vlov lowers his arm.
Maybe recognizing that his flaming hand isn't working, he confronts the enemy in front of him only by observing her.
<Page27>
"...But no discipline. To make their way into such a remote place, that is the mark of a starving animal. When have executors become beasts so fond of foul attacks?"
<Page28>
"The one who's starving is you.
I don't know what Dead Apostle you are, so if you have a name, please introduce yourself.
It will guide us when we sort through documents at a later date."
<Page29>
"...I don't have a name to give.
As you see, I am an avenger who crossed the sea in a coffin."
<Page30>
"A coffin... Yesterday, we raised the matter of an unknown transport shipwrecked on the coast. Was that you?
Thank you for coming from so far away. Wasn't there enough food in liberty in your hometown anymore? To go on an expedition to a foreign country where even the men are of a different race, there is no greater fall from grace."
<Page31>
She said it in a detached tone, but it's a strong provocation.
Even I could see that it's intended to get on his nerves.
<Page32>
"...Indeed, Executor.
From the beginning, there wasn't much food in my country. The storehouse of the castle has long been emptied. The humans too have fled a century ago. Even you, dogs, won't come near my land.
It truly is a barren life without a single blade of grass. But I was content with it. It is entirely different from such a sore sight as this city."
<Page33>
...Unbelievable.
He wasn't responding to her provocation. Not only that, he was having a proper conversation with a human...!
<Page34>
Is something different from last time at the hotel?
It's probably hunger. How full his stomach is.//Explicit 腹の具合
From what I can tell, he has now more than fully satiated both his mind and body...!
<Page35>
"Then why did you come to this city?
To a man of the countryside, poverty is a virtue, isn't it?"
"―――The reason I set foot in this country is... treatment and revenge.
I came to this hideous city to escape the pain ripping apart my body, the pain ripping apart my heart."
<Page36>
"...Hmph. I expected a sensible explanation, but it just comes down to hunger. I'm disappointed. You don't have to give your name. You have no choice but to suck human blood. You're nothing more than a run-of-the-mill Dead Apostle."
<Page37>
...How did Vlov react to Senpai's words?
In an instant, his hostility and killing intent increase.
He's staring at her with the same eyes he had back at the hotel.
<Page38>
"...Sullied Executor. Aren't you cold?
Have you ever felt cold?
Don't you understand my suffering?"
"―――I don't. Heat and ice, I've left them behind in the distant past."
<Page39>
"...I see. What a difficult woman.
Then, follow in the steps of that <woman|t e a c h e r >. I have no more words for you."
<Page40>
The vampire's right arm is turned toward Senpai.
"Again with Fire Cry?
Do you think a curse of merely that level can burn me?"
<Page41>
"Merely that level...?"
A whisper harboring a hidden meaning.
As if mocking his enemy's negligence,
"―――And what level exactly is this?"
This time with all his power, he unleashes his true devouring flames.//真の劫火, can probably find something better sounding
<Page42>
Like a river of flames breaking through a dam and gushing forth.
It's on an entirely different level from the 'hand' just earlier.
A turbid torrent that would easily engulf not only Senpai but also me and Noel-sensei behind her.//Turbid or muddy, flood, torrent, river, stream, current. I like the alliteration in turbid torrent...
<Page43>
Facing the overwhelming flames―――
<Page44>
"Now now, what am I going to do?"
While saying such a thing, she turns her back against the flames.
<Page45>
"S-Senpai!?
What do you mean, 'what am I going to do', we have to run away, quick!"
<Page46>
"Oh right, I didn't explain it to you, Tohno-kun.
Errr, please be at ease. Flames that are created by magecraft have no effect on me."
<Page47>
'Ahem' goes Senpai, puffing her chest.
As she says, the river of flames completely stops in front of her... well, in front of her back.
So much that I couldn't even feel the heat, let alone any sparks.
<Page48>
"Ah, no... but, your body..."
Noel-sensei and I are safe, but Senpai's body is apparently still burning...
<Page49>
"Thank you for your concern. But, don't worry about it, it's not hot. Contrary to the 'hand' from earlier, this one is conceptual magecraft. My body can stop it.
Anyway, it's safe. I'll stay like this for a little while. I could go defeat him right now, but you could be dragged into the fight. First, I'll make him exhaust his magical energy."
<Page50>
"Ah... y-yes."
Dumbfounded, I just nod.
<Page51>
She's just like the Senpai I know.
In the midst of this hell, she's just like the Senpai that helped me on that night.
<Page52>
This made me happy, but also uneasy.
If this is routine work for her, then until now what did I see of her―――
<Page53>
"This should be it... Keeping up for this much firepower for more than two minutes, where the average mage would be exhausted after one hit... I wouldn't have expected such a powerful curse from a common Dead Apostle. But this is the end. Any more shouldn't be―――"
<Page54>
Ciel-senpai's voice clouds with doubt.
Vlov is suffering.
Keeping up this river of flames is clearly weakening him.
<Page55>
...And yet, I feel a growing sense of foreboding.
Because his eyes are clouding up the more he used his <blood|p o w e r >.
And that this is causing the temperature in the chapel to suddenly decrease.
<Page56>
―――I see.
It was the same at the hotel. Arcueid said that he was a user of flames. But he's not. On the contrary. He's in pain not because he's craving for blood but―――
<Page57>
"Senpai...!"
I cry out to the girl in front of me, who seems invulnerable.
It seems that she too noticed the change in the situation... and her own error.
<Page58>
"―――――――――So cold."
The river of flames disappears.
The layers of the air creak and crack.
<Page59>
He grasps his chest in agony.
His mouth opens wide as if to spit out all the internal organs of his body.
<Page60>
His paranoia-tinged hatred...//His hatred-grudge influenced-colored-fuelled by his delusion of persecution-paranoia-persecution complex
"He's not just a Dead Apostle...!//Just in italics, ruby dots <只|・>
Arcueid said he's one of the Ancestors!"
"W-What―――?!!!"
"――――――This place. Is cold."
Turns into a white wall blanketing the cavity.//I chose cavity for 広間
