<Page1>
It's a scene my eyes could scarcely believe.
<Page2>
A dome-shaped cavity 40 meters high.
The floor is carefully polished.
The ceiling is supported by numerous pillars.
In the center of the ceiling, there's a window-like hole from which the greyish sunlight fell. It's exactly like a <sunbeam|J a c o b ' s  l a d d e r> peeking through gaps in the clouds.
<Page3>
And right underneath where the sunlight fell, there's a sleeping platform.//I think the literally translation of 寝台 sound pretty okay, "bed" is really strange, though I also use it from time to time
A girl is lying on this bed made of stone.
<Page4>
Around her is a countless number of the Dead.
There are roughly thirty of them gathered in the dome.
They are roaming all around the platform.
<Page5>
...It seems that this platform has particular meaning to them considering they're not approaching it.
<Page6>
"...A sacrifice? That's, a sacrifice... isn't it?"
".........."
<Page7>
We hide ourselves in the corridor and peek into the dome without setting foot inside.
The Dead are focused on the slab and didn't notice us approaching.
That one fact is our sole stroke of luck, but I didn't expect that situation.
<Page8>
"...We're separated by about 60 meters..."
We're too far away to get a good look at the girl's face, but I could tell that she's alive.
<Page9>
Because there are no traces of blood on her uniform.
That girl was put to sleep unharmed on the sleeping platform.
...Probably.
To get devoured by those guys at a later point.
<Page10>
"...This is it then. At this point, nothing can be done to save her.
Let's go back, Shiki-kun. No one will reproach us if we escape."
"――――――"
<Page11>
A voice calls out from behind my back.
I bite my lips at this undisputable reality.
<Page12>
What Noel-sensei said is right.
...Going around along the wall so that the corpses don't notice us and save that girl? It's fine up to that point, but what comes after? Can we escape while carrying her? From that platform to the entrance where we are? Impossible. That's absolutely not realistic. Enough, I should drum into my head the limits of what I can do.
<Page13>
"―――But."
Is it really impossible?
I have a weapon in my hand. It should be a weapon.
The limits of what I can do. Is that really just running away?
<Page14>
Certainly, it's probably impossible to save that girl.
But, it's not absolutely impossible.//absolutely in italics
There's still a possibility, no matter how slight, that she can be saved.
<Page15>
"Wait... Shiki-kun?"
"―――Go hide in the direction of the passageway, Sensei. I'll hide behind a pillar and get as close as I can."
<Page16>
"S-Stop it! Your face is so pale and you're trembling, so what are you saying?!"
<Page17>
Overcoming my hesitation, I gaze at the center of the dome.
...I didn't come here to risk my life to save that girl. I came here planning, not to save people, but to kill that vampire.
...But I can't leave alone a life right in front of me.
<Page18>
I'm not consistent. I'm contradicting myself.
I'm feeble-minded, even in such a place.
But still―――
<Page19>
"Sure I'm afraid... but now, I think this is the right thing to do."
To save people, I'll kill things that are shaped like people.
I realize the unsightliness of running away from my guilt, of the selfishness of wanting to prove my usefulness, of deceiving myself.
I don't deny anymore that I'm a good-for-nothing.
<Page20>
But. I also want to do what I can.
If I run away here, then I'll really be <an incompetent|j u s t  a  > murderer. There's no way I'll be able to atone for my sins then.
<Page21>
I remove my glasses.
I look directly at the 'death' of the swarming corpses.
<Page22>
The side of my head <erupts into pain|c r a c k s    >.//側頭部 is the temporal lobe
I stifle the pain by taking a deep breath. First, behind the closest pillar―――
<Page23>
"Eh... eh, awawawawawa!?
S-Sorry, I dropped the torch!"
"Ugh――――!"
<Page24>
I react instantaneously.
As soon as the sound started to reverberate, I break into a run.
<Page25>
Before the zombies turn to the direction of the sound... to the entrance where we both are, quick, eliminate what's in the way first.
I must eliminate them.
I don't have the luxury of safely moving around from pillar to pillar anymore.
Since I've been noticed, I'll go with the shortest way, in a direct straight line, to the sleeping platform―――!
<Page26>
"Haaa...!"
<Page27>
I take a particularly deep breath.
Having run as fast as I could, I rest my body against the platform.
It was a clear act of murder, done with my own volition. I hold back the urge to vomit.
<Page28>
In a backhand grip, I hold the knife that sliced through their lines―――through their lives.
Behind me, I can hear the voices coming from the group of dead bodies, who finally noticed the intruders.
<Page29>
I don't have the time to turn around.
I lift in my arms the unfamiliar schoolgirl that was put to sleep on the bed.
It's rough but if she doesn't wake up even if I knock her around, we'll never be able to escape from he―――//Someone check this
<Page30>
"Um... I'm awake."
"Huh?"
<Page31>
I unintentionally let out such an exclamation.
Because that schoolgirl I don't recognize woke up before I arrived.
<Page32>
"Uh... I mean, are you alright?!"
"...I'm fine... but, why... why did you come here...?"
<Page33>
The schoolgirl says in a faltering voice and looks up with uneasiness in her eyes.
I don't have the time to explain to her the situation.
<Page34>
"Can you stand?! This way!"
<Page35>
I hold her hand and help her up the platform.
Good, it seems she can walk on her own.
The problem is...
How do we get past all the dead bodies surrounding us?
<Page36>
"......."
I wonder if the Dead don't want to come close to the bed; they look at us while circling the platform.
<Page37>
...How long will this last?
Staying here isn't safe. We don't have any other choice but to break through. I have to make a path, not just for me but also to take the girl along.
For that, I'll have to start with these zombi―――
<Page38>
"Ahh, this is getting completely off-script, but fine!
I'm at the end of my patience too!"
<Page39>
Thump. A spectacular attack.
A body flew through the air like a trash bag.
I recognize it as the body of one of the zombies standing near the entrance.
<Page40>
"Noel-sensei...!?"
I saw right in front of my eyes the preposterous appearance of the woman who I call teacher.
<Page41>
"Just because I'm investigating undercover, they're getting cocky!//Need double check
I mean, those Rank I small fry laying a hand on my favorite student, that's just absurd!"
<Page42>
"Look, Shiki-kun, Super Confession Time will begin shortly!"
<Page43>
With a whoosh, she swings her long-handled weapon around her like a whirlwind.
Where did the clothes she had worn go? Noel-sensei, now wearing the garment of a nun, crushes the herd of zombies.
<Page44>
"―――Eeeeeh?!"
I can't close my mouth.
The sister wielding her long-handled weapon scatters the Dead around like she's dancing.
<Page45>
With a wide smile and sparkling eyes, she made her nun's skirt flutter around, even turning up the fanservice by blowing kisses here and there. Those are deliberate acts that makes me want to shout 'act your age!' at her.
<Page46>
The Dead conspicuously move away from the platform to face the new threat that is Noel-sensei.//Not sure I understood the first part correctly, needs check
<Page47>
"There, Shiki-kun, this way, this way! Hide behind Sensei!"
Noel-sensei is rampaging without a care for what the Dead are doing.
<Page48>
Noel-sensei arrives to the platform after smashing the dead bodies.
Her weapon is a spear made of steel, almost two meters long.
The tip of the spear has an axe-like part to it.
This is probably what is called a halberd.
<Page49>
"Aaaah that's disgusting, I've got blood and grease sticking everywhere. That's why everyone hates fresh zombies. Yup, nothing better than smashing up a rattling skeleton, right?"
<Page50>
Noel-sensei gives a good swing of her halberd to clear away the blood stuck on the tip.
...It's real steel. But just looking at it, it's not something she should be able to swing around with her slender arms.
<Page51>
"Ah, no―――Sensei, what in the world is that?!"
"Hmmm isn't it fine? Don't sweat the small stuff ♡.# For now just let Sensei take care of you. After all, I may not look like it but I'm pretty strong!"
<Page52>
With a cheerfulness as if something put aside all her hesitation, Noel-sensei charges the group of zombies.//吹っ切れる=reserves, hesitation, misgivings, doubt go away, disappear
<Page53>
Bodies cut in half one after the other, lumps of meat flying around.
Mercilessly swinging down her mass of iron on the fleeing dead bodies,
Throwing her long and narrow weapon at those trying to get close, skewering them.
No matter how you look at it, she's even more of an 'abnormality' than the Dead.
<Page54>
"Isn't being a sister just a hobby?!"
"Nah, teaching is the hobby ♡.
It's fine, just stay there, and I'll clean up real quick!"
<Page55>
I call out to her to stop her but she doesn't pay attention.
Noel-sensei kicks around the zombies close to her and jumps to where even more are gathered.
<Page56>
"...Ugh"
There, I realize that my hand is being held tightly.
It's the schoolgirl that was lying on the sleeping platform. She's looking with uneasiness at what's happening.
<Page57>
"........"
"Sorry, I'm lost. I also really don't understand... but she'll be fine. I think Sensei is stronger than all the zombies here. It'll be better to stay put."
<Page58>
I let go of her hand.
I conclude that we better remain here and wait for Noel-sensei to exterminate all the zombies, rather than clumsily trying to run away.
<Page59>
"...?"
Suddenly, I feel a chill running through my back.
<Page60>
...It's cold.
It's not my imagination, the temperature clearly dropped.
Looking at my feet, the floor is beginning to be covered in frost.
As if responding to the cold air, the Dead become agitated. They're... It's almost like they're afraid of something.
<Page61>
"――――――Blood."
I just realized.
The blood from the crushed corpses was flowing down into pattern engraved in the floor.//Added engraved
Like some sort of ritual that would summon something bad.//Something bad in italics, ruby dots <よ|・><く|・><な|・><い|・><モ|・><ノ|・>
<Page62>
"Noel-sensei!"
The voice that called out Sensei wasn't mine, but that of the female student next to me.
But those words don't reach her.
The woman clothed like a nun, intoxicated by the blood spraying all over, only looks at the zombies she's pulverizing.
<Page63>
"Novice, stop! Pay attention to your surroundings!"
"Huh?"
<Page64>
Noel-sensei finally notices the voice coming from the female student.
Because she's only focusing on the Dead, her body which is left defenseless,
is engulfed and calcinated, along with the Dead, by the flames erupting from the inside of the passageway.//丸焼き is roasted, really talking about food
