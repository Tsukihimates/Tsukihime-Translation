...Arcueid is right.
For a vampire... no, from a tactical viewpoint, focusing on restoring our fighting strength without considering potential victims makes sense.
<Page2>
"...Right, I guess. You are a vampire after all."
<Page3>
But, I can't.
Despite that, I can't agree with Arcueid's plan.
When I decided to fight, it wasn't only for my own survival.
<Page4>
"I know what you're going to do.
But can we really not take them by surprise? You said that sleeping Dead Apostles are cautious, but how dangerous could they be?"
<Page5>
I think about how Arcueid was yesterday.
She was completely defenseless while asleep.
Other animals may be vulnerable during sleep as well, but in her case, it swings more towards carelessness... She was just like a machine cut off from electricity.
<Page6>
...If so, we have a chance to win.
I can't even get close to Vlov normally, but if he's asleep, I've got a surefire way to kill him――― 
<Page7>
"How dangerous is it? It's almost like attacking a castle.
Dead Apostles build strong fortresses and sleep deep within them.
Everything from the main gate to the bowels is guarded by retainers, so it would probably be night by the time we break through."
<Page8>
"'By the time we break through'... would it be difficult for you to attack Vlov's castle, even at full-strength?"// quotation marks might look awkward
<Page9>
"Don't take me so lightly. If I wasn't weakened, I would have crushed his castle head-on.
...Well, he would have simply run away in that case.
Experienced Dead Apostles prepare their escape route in advance, and if an individual stronger than themselves approaches, they will flee at once.“
<Page10>
"...If an individual stronger than themselves approaches..."
In other words, if it's a single insignificant human, there is a good chance that he will keep on sleeping without being alerted.
<Page11>
It's an advantage that Arcueid doesn't have, but I do.
It takes a lot of firepower to destroy a castle.
But a bit of poison is enough to kill a single living being.
<Page12>
"I get it. You're right, it's going to be difficult for both of us to attack.
...But is Vlov's stronghold really that dangerous? Ah, I'm talking about the size, the number of minions, that kind of stuff."
<Page13>
"Hmm, around lower-middle in terms of difficulty. It's more of a maze than a castle, and it's just a department store after all.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the entrance. I don't think I'm wrong about that."
<Page14>
"A department store?"
That's not a technical term used by vampires that I can't understand right? She's talking about a normal department store where people go shopping, isn't she? 
<Page15>
"Yes. The big one in front of the park at the north gate.
It's well hidden, but it's the nest of that Dead Apostle. I think the food is being sent to the Castle Lord through it."
<Page16>
"I-It really is that department store! N-No, more importantly, this means there's a vampire den in the middle of the city!?”
<Page17>
"W-What? I wasn't the one that set it up! 
Ants and bees nest in your house, don't they? 
It's the same thing. Considering that Dead Apostles are parasites that live on human blood, the closer their home is to a human city, the more efficient they are."
<Page18>
"――――――"
I turn away from Arcueid, who says such a thing as if it were obvious.
...I'm even more determined.
I'm not going to let a pest like him remain so close for even one more second.
<Page19>
...Right.
What Arcueid can't do, 
I'll do. I'll do it even if I'm alone.
