"...What the hell,# are you serio-?"
"Eh, it's all good Toshi! The more the merrier after all!
And look at his lame clothes, that's Souya uniform! He'll get along with those girls we captured a while ago, they're from the same school after all!"
<Page2>
"――――――"
I somehow keep my calm.//Manage to keep my calm?
'Those girls we captured a while ago'... That means that before me, there were people who talked to these guys and were captured.
<Page3>
"...Mmm, whatever. Those girls were certainly dumb.
Sure, you want a part-time job? I'll take you there."
"Hyuu! One brave challenger, coming right up!"
<Page4>
The man called Haru presses the elevator button.
<Page5>
"...Ugh"
The sound of a machine echoes in the darkness.
It seems to be the only thing here connected to power.
<Page6>
"There, get inside."
...I follow his instructions and enter the elevator.
The pair follows me inside and one of them presses the B1 button.
<Page7>
"...Um, to what floor?"
"We're headed to the basement, the basement. Don't you see the B1? That's where you should stay the night. And when you come back, you'll become a guest of honor. We'll roll the red carpet for you."//丁重に
<Page8>
"Yep yep, it's suuuper simple! You just need to stay there, there's nothing scary at all!"
The man called Haru breaks into a guffaw while holding his stomach.
<Page9>
...The descent is awfully long.
According to my body senses, the basement is maybe as high as four floors.//Someone double check this
<Page10>
"Hnng...!?"
The elevator doors open and I'm immediately assailed by an intense light.
It's so dazzling that I can't make out what's outside.
But I could smell a stench the likes of which I've never experienced before.
Unable to bear the smell, I cover my nose with my hand, before trying to look outside―――
<Page11>
"Coming right up, one piece of fresh meeeeat!
Have fun getting eaten!"
I'm kicked in the back and flung outside.
<Page12>
"Wha...?!"
The feeling of falling.
And not just one or two meters.
Did that elevator stop in mid-air?!
<Page13>
"Bwah...!"
Underneath the elevator is a pool.
I must have fallen around five meters.
<Page14>
Raising my head from the water's surface, I look up to see that the elevator has stopped.
The man who kicked me is looking down at me with a grin on his face.
<Page15>
"Ugh, that guy...!"
Anyway, I move my arms and legs and swim toward the shore.
The water is becoming a sticky mess, and I get the impression that just being in it is dangerous.
<Page16>
After swimming about ten meters, I reach the shore.
"Haa, haa, haa―――"
My head and my body are still confused.
With my shoulders heaving, I look around at my surroundings.//肩で息をしながら, to breathe with effort, difficulty
<Page17>
...Damn, the lights are so bright I can't see properly.
What I can make out is that this is a decently large room, with many paths extending forward around it. And from I feel from my shoes, the floor is made of stone.
<Page18>
In addition, there's a horrible stench that assails my nose.
The smell of rotting flesh. The smell of foul water. The smell of feces and urine. Stagnant and moribund, it's unmistakably the air of a sewer.
<Page19>
'Aa... aaa, AAAAAA.....'
"...!?"
I look up at that rushing sound.
I'm not mishearing it.
The sound of footsteps approaching, one after the other.
I look around, hiding my eyes from the light, and there,
Gathering in the open space is a group of people, no, those are already no more than corpses.
<Page20>
Their eyes are bloodshot. Their flesh cut and torn down. Their clothes in tatters.
From their mouths come out sounds. Were they sobs? Or shrieks? I can't tell.
Their shadows are exactly like those of the Dead I saw in the back alley.
But, they are―――
<Page21>
"Hu... man."
My mind freezes.
At the back of that gathering of people, just a step behind, I see them approaching. And I understand which group really is 'alive'.//"them" in italics, or needs to be replaced by something more explicit like "those things"
<Page22>
"Run a―――!"
I raise my voice, but it's too late.
I stand opposite across the shore to them.
Crossing over would take only a few seconds, but I don't even have the strength for that.
<Page23>
'Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!'
A booming voice crying out in desperation.
<Page24>
They're... human.
Like me, they were dropped here. That's what remains of those people days later.
They heard the sound of the elevator and saw the light, and they gathered here to beg for help.
...Meaning, the prey were gathered in a single place.
<Page25>
"Waaa, incredible~! Are you still alive, you poor bastaaards?
They are still alive! Hahaha, wow, that's just great! This is so stupid, I can't stop laughing!"
<Page26>
The laughing voice echoes from the elevator.
<Page27>
"――――――, ha"
My head hurts.
I feel nauseous.
The footsteps are coming closer.
My instincts scream that I will be attacked if I stay here.
<Page28>
"Haa―――haa, haa―――!"
Driven by my fear, I start running.
<Page29>
Even though I know that the only way out is the elevator five meters above me, I have to get away from here.
Fully focused, I jump into the darkness in front of me.
