It's been two hours since Vlov Arkhangel disappeared from the surface of the earth#.
The traffic restrictions and shutout of the media organized by the Mobile Engineer Unit continue up to the present time.
<Page2>
A cover-up operation that prevents any video recording, let alone an investigation of the cave-in. The person in charge is not a police officer or an officer of Self-Defense Forces.
It's a golden-haired, blue-eyed foreigner.
A young boy who, from his appearance, appears to be no more than twelve years old.
<Page3>
"Ohh ohh. They're really doing whatever they want, huh? The Marble Phantasm of a True Ancestor on top of a Dead Apostle's catacomb. Isn't Japan one of Asia's vaunted advanced countries? When did it turn into a village from the Middle Ages?
Hasn't been this kind of big fuss since that happened thirteen years ago, huuuh? Hey, you listening Andou? I'm talking about your country, fucker."
<Page4>
"I wouldn't know what to say even if you asked me, young master. They call it a high-tech country, but that was in the past, like ten years ago, no? This country has stagnated, both its technology and its people. If you have complaints... no, reproaches, please direct them to the executor in charge."
<Page5>
The young man deflects the golden-haired boy's foul-mouthed question in a practiced manner.
Below them is the crater that had become a battlefield#.
If they looked down, they would see several figures hurrying about their work inside the crater.
There is the rescue unit dispatched to save lives at the disaster site, as well as the investigation team dispatched from the relevant police section.
They are working to clean up this strange scene while being kept in the dark concerning the truth of the accident.
<Page6>
"But, are you okay with that, young master, not using our own people?
I mean, even with a gag order, there's going to be leaks, right?"
<Page7>
"Don't sweat it. Japanese people are passionate about their work, no? They'll have to keep the secret if that is what their organization's policy is.
Even if it leaks, it'll be nothing more than a rumor. Besides, there's nothing incredible to having dead bodies at the scene of an accident."
<Page8>
"Well, maybe it's not incredible, but isn't there something strange about that? Like, where were all the dead bodies?"//Recheck here
<Page9>
"Listen you, the corpses we found here are the bodies of the poor civilians who had been here tonight. Dead bodies found equal humans who were alive until now, capeesh?"
"Geh. Seriously? Will something so convenient work?"
<Page10>
"It will. Ahh, we're lucky it happened in a public park. We can use the fact that there were a ton of unrelated people present."
<Page11>
"As long as we have a pretext, the rest is just a matter of manpower. Why do you think my old man's handing out power for? The only people we have to keep in check are the ones on top. It doesn't matter if the underlings or those in the middle get suspicious. As long as the people in charge at the end don't let anything through, it'll go nowhere."
<Page12>
"...Haa, that's harsh. I see, so that's how it's going to be hushed up.# Young master, at your age, you're going on the fast track at full speed. Speaking of your pedigree and mentality. I mean, you don't feel the desire to act a bit more like your age and have some fun?"
<Page13>
"No way, I don't. You've forgotten that brats are just basically a pain, you geezer? Hey, stop talking nonsense and go supervise. And make sure to destroy any dangerous evidence."//He says 30歳, thirty year-old. Just imagine that I thought about "30 year old boomer" for a second haha
"Yeah. If those are my boss' order, with pleasure."
<Page14>
"...If only he had some sense of urgency, he'd be more useful then. To be so low-spirited, did he break down when he was young, what do you think, Karius?"
<Page15>
"I haven't the slightest idea. I don't have any interest in Andou's private life.
I only know that he decided to blow the whistle on a corrupt priest, but at the last minute, was betrayed by his lover who had been blinded by the promises of riches, was driven out from his hometown, and was, at the depths of despair, exiled to Japan, his paternal native country.
Also, it seems that after he paid back 30,000 yen to a bank last month, he took another loan of around 60,000 yen."
<Page16>
"...You sure know a lot though. Anyways, it's good that you're close. Currently, Andou and you are my only subordinates after all. Improve your teamwork."
"I will comply if that is what you desire, Mario-sama."
<Page17>
"Ohh, you're close yes. Well, it's time to hear the report then.
You can let that useless woman go through."
<Page18>
"........."
A woman with a nervous look on her face appears.
Executor Noel. She is one of the few people who know the full truth of the incident.
<Page19>
"I am Mario Gallo Bestino. As of today, I've been newly appointed as Supervising Priest Executor.
It's the first time we've met, right, Executor Noel?"
"B-Bestino, you mean, as in 'Laurentis'...!?"
<Page20>
Her surprise is completely understandable.
His name is not something that can be ignored by the people of the Church.
The Pope, the pinnacle of the Holy Church.
As well as the 128 Cardinals assisting him.
Even amongst those who hold the highest of power, Cardinal Laurentis is certainly said to be the most influential and the next in line to become Pope. His grandson is Mario, this present boy.
<Page21>
That being said, Mario isn't related by blood to him, as Cardinals are not allowed to marry.
As a general rule, they adopt children, raise them, and prepare them as successors.
This isn't blood nepotism but meritocracy.//血族主義 is actually not an real compound word, though readily understandably. DeepL proposed bloodocracy, which is pretty nice. I learned that the word nepotism actually find its roots in the practice of Cardinals appointing nephews to important positions, which is perfect here, except that nepotism today also works for friends. So blood nepotism.
Only those who hold stronger faith, deeper knowledge, and firmer morals are chosen to serve as the pillars of the House of God.
<Page22>
―――But.
Cardinal Laurentis had an open secret.
He adopted many children, handed them his fortune, but all of his sons closely resembled him.
<Page23>
The Cardinal is a lustful man, a vulgar person who became Cardinal because of his money and influence.
This is the image that many of the faithful have of him.
<Page24>
Of course, the priests who know Cardinal Laurentis are aware of the truth. Piety, thoughtfulness, charisma. All of which makes him worthy of supporting the Church.//I chose charisma for 人間力 but it could be a lot of other things
His one and only flaw is his love of women.
<Page25>
His grandson... that's the adamant official version... Mario is known as a late-blooming successor, highly thought, particularly of Cardinal Laurentis.
<Page26>
The surname Bestino is the old family name of Cardinal Laurentis, back from where he was still living in the remote countryside. All the faithful know very well just how much is expected of the young boy who was granted this surname, over more than twenty other adopted sons... no, over more than twenty of his brothers.
<Page27>
The treasured son of a powerful man who has hidden himself from the public eye and entered a life of seclusion.
It's not surprising that a simple executor like Noel would tremble in front of that boy.
...That's exactly why she's asking herself.
The elite amongst the elite who is assured a future in his home country.
Why has such a boy come to this island nation all alone...?
<Page28>
"B-But... Really?"
"Haa? You want me to show a license or what? You're making fun of fun me 'cause I'm a kid?"
<Page29>
"N-No, I would never...!
I-It's just... Umm, for the grandson of a Cardinal, you're... sort of... too young?"
<Page30>
"Sure, I'm young. I'm the child of a mistress the old man impregnated when he was more than a hundred years old. I'm twelve this year, surprised? And what's more, I even have some younger brothers.
...Sheesh, our old man is even more of a stud than vampires."//絶倫 is often used in a sexual manner, and considering the reaction just below, I prefer to use someone rather explicit.
<Page31>
"P-Priest Executor Mario...!
W-What are you saying...?!"
<Page32>
"Just grumbling, ignore it.# And I know you're not deeply pious in truth. Don't force yourself to have a 'proper reaction'.
'nyways, let's get down to business. I couldn't make it for the beginning, I only saw the very end."
<Page33>
"Ah―――Ah, yes.
By 'the beginning', when exactly was that... sir?"
<Page34>
"Around when you dipshit ran away. That was a good decision, Executor Noel, huh? Thanks to that, you're still alive. A third-rate doing like third-rates do and putting her shitty life ahead, huh?
The only thing you're good at is running away. Those who've served as disposable dogs for almost ten years should have some backbone. As soon as I return to the Vatican, I'll have your head. And I don't mean I'll send you to a monastery. I mean I'll send you to the guillotine."//首を切る meaning to fire someone and to behead someone.
<Page35>
"Huuh―――?"
Her thoughts couldn't keep up with the sudden death sentence.
For a few seconds, she was overwhelmed by a terror such that her heart seemed to stop.
<Page36>
"W-Wait please...!
T-There's a, umm, really good reason―――!"
<Page37>
Desperate, she pleads and falls down on her knees.
Fleeing and leaving behind her fighting partner Ciel.
It wasn't a decision taken to save herself.
She says that it was entirely so she could call for help, that she was doing it to kill the vampire that she really targeted, that she had no choice but to reluctantly retreat.
<Page38>
"―――Ohh. Your real target?
What is it then? Do you mean that you and that woman you're working with actually have different targets?"
<Page39>
"Y-Yes, yes!
I'm not lying. I can even submit myself to the questions of the Vatican! As a Priest Executor, you can do that much, right?!"//She doesn't say 司祭代行 like everywhere else but 司祭代理. I'm not sure if it should be translated differently.
<Page40>
"It doesn't work that way, you moron. Your partner is from the Burial Agency. They have extraterritorial rights. Even the old man's power doesn't apply to those guys. Even I've just learned now that you're in this city."
<Page41>
"And by the way, Priest Executor is nothing more than a title.
Executors are allowed independent authority on-site until the incident is resolved―――That's an absolute rule in the Church. Don't be so blinded by the power of lineage."
<Page42>
"Eh... T-Then, that just now was... a lie?"
"It's not a lie. Those are my unvarnished, true feelings. It's just that a kid doesn't have that authority."
<Page43>
"But hey, I listened to your little story, right? So let's hear what you have to say about your real target. You and that woman's target. Since when have you been undercover, investigating and whatever else?"
<Page44>
Noel realizes her own slip of the tongue, but knows she can't cover it up now that it's come to this.
She reports to the Priest Executor, who arrived from the home country, the content of the investigation, she, as well as her partner Executor, conducted over the last month.
<Page45>
She concludes her report after speaking for about ten minutes.
Briefly, and insisting the responsibility for the investigation fell, not on her, but entirely on her partner.
<Page46>
"So you've been trying to earn points, relying on baseless unconfirmed information.
So that's it. You've been working without consulting anyone. Good good. In that case, we don't need to fight each other. Doesn't it look like we can cooperate, Executor Noel?"
<Page47>
"Priest Executor...? What is that supposed to mean?"
<Page48>
"Fool, get it in your head that we're birds of a feather.
I'll keep it under wraps. Your private rampaging. It would be inconvenient if the higher-ups got wind of the fact that you're chasing after him, right?"//him in italics, ruby dots <ヤ|・><ツ|・>
<Page49>
"Under wraps... Then, umm... Does that mean I won't receive a punishment...?"
<Page50>
"There can't be any punishment. After all, I haven't seen any Executor or such, and besides, they don't take orders from me. Until the matter is closed, let's leave it to that.
Honestly, the only people I can freely order around are those who have influence in this country. I can't mobilize the Church's Tactical Unit. I can only use them at the very last moment, to bring it to an end. That's why, until then, I want to have a piece I could easily use."
<Page51>
"In other words... You mean that, just for now, we're equals?"
"Ahhh, let's say that we're helping each other out.
That being said, when everything's over, our positions will return to what they were originally. If you want to have a nice life in the future, then shake your ass.
The more you throw yourself to me, the more good I'll say of you to the old man. That's the chance of a lifetime for a nobody like you, ya know?"
<Page52>
The Executors are indeed granted special rights on the battlefield, but inside the Church, they are of the lower class.
In exchange for some privileges and freedom as soldiers, they are deprived of the opportunity to raise their status.
Executors head to battle and are consumed as commodities on the battlefield.
To someone like Noel, the young boy's words are an extraordinary stroke of luck.
<Page53>
...However, Noel couldn't honestly be pleased.
It may have been an unbelievable foothold to better prospects in life, but it was no more than a verbal promise.
<Page54>
To begin with, the boy is completely looking down on Noel.
The antipathy she feels toward a kid, not even half her age, wielding his power around... What's more, and although Noel herself isn't aware of it, she harbors a primal hatred for the people of the Church.
It would be difficult for her to hold a favorable opinion of Mario, unless something significant happens.
<Page55>
"What? You aren't happy? Shouldn't you rejoice and lick my shoes? You're a dog and you're not even grateful. Rather than dog, should I call you a pig instead?"//Ehh, 雌犬 is a female dog, a bitch, 反応悪い is a bad reaction.
<Page56>
"N-No, that's not really... It's just that I'm not used to such good fortune suddenly coming to me, ahaha..."
<Page57>
"Anyways, umm, speaking of promotion, what will happen to that girl?
...Even now, I still can't believe it, but she really defeated an Ancestor, right? So with that, will her treatment improve? I mean, that's her first kill of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors."
<Page58>
"Haaa? Don't be so dumb, you turkey.
There's no way she's going to get a higher position for killing a vampire, even one who's a monster impacting the whole country."//ruby dots <吸|・><血|・><鬼|・><殺|・><し|・>
<Page59>
Mario ridicules Noel, who timidly spoke out.
She feels increasingly repulsed, but at the time, relieved.
The sovereigns of Dead Apostles. Because, even going on what could be said to be the highest class of heresy hunting for Executors, that girl won't be treated differently.
―――However.
<Page60>
"And to begin with, it's not her first."
"―――Excuse me?"
This time around, Noel really speaks out in surprise.
<Page61>
The Priest Executor, who showed up in the Far East, looks down at the crater that had been witness to the battle, and,
"As I said, this isn't her first kill of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors.
Including 'Forest' and 'Castle', this is her third one."
With cold eyes, he tells of the combat record of the Executor who had already left.
<Page62>
"I'm baack. Oh? Where's the cute young lady I briefly saw from below? Has she already gone back?"
<Page63>
"I had Karius send her back. And I also have a briefing afterward.
It's no use talking about the Burial Agency, but that girl is easy to understand. Dangle a carrot in front of her, and she'll run until she dies.//I'm not sure what 走るタマ is. Is it like 球が走る in baseball or 霊?
'nyways, how did it go on your side?"
<Page64>
"Weell, there's nothing left.#Things like Scriptures about Dead Apostles or the vampire's Soul Remains? Not even the corpses are left, it looks like that executor collected everything."
"Tch, that fucking bitch again. Spoils of war should always be left as tribute. She's making fun of our organization's hierarchy, huh?"
<Page65>
"Weell, I wouldn't know what to do, if such incomprehensible things were loaded off to me.//It would be best to rephrase it to delete the pronouns
Every man to his trades, so isn't it fine to leave monsters to the monster-killer?"
<Page66>
"That's why we'll be in trouble if the monster-killer becomes a monster.//we'll be in trouble if the monster-killer becomes a monster in italics, ruby dots <化|・><け|・><物|・><殺|・><し|・><が|・><化|・><け|・><物|・><に|・><な|・><っ|・><た|・><ら|・><困|・><る|・><ん|・><だ|・><よ|・>
...Listen, you stay here and supervise for a bit. Tomorrow, the owner of this area will come, so get ready to meet them.# I'll go look for the True Ancestor and get familiar with the city. And don't forget to stay in regular contact."
<Page67>
"Wah!? Young master, you're going to do such an unglamorous and manual task personally!? But that's my job!?"
<Page68>
"...You're really spewing some crap, Andou. How could I leave the task of following the True Ancestor to you? You'd be crossing over to the other world in a day."
"Young master... I didn't know that you cared so much..."
"I still don't have any spare pawns. If you die, I'll get tired. If I get more personnel, be assured that I'll leave it to you then."
<Page69>
"―――Yeah, I figured that was the reason.
But, young master, will you be fine? Fundamentally you're just a frail little kid, right, young master?"
"Even without magecraft, sacraments, or the likes, I'm still better than you lots. Even if I'm discovered, I'm acquainted with the True Ancestor. I won't get killed."//I think that's said, recheck please
<Page70>
"Eh, wait... For the esteemed grandson of a Cardinal to be the acquaintance of a vampire, that's going to stir up much than a scandal, right?!"
<Page71>
Ignoring his shout of surprise, the young boy walks away.
First, to investigate the town and prepare for battle.
Then―――To confirm the presence of the beautiful vampire princess he met many years ago already, his memories of which were fading.//Someone rephrase this もう何年も前に遭遇し、記憶から薄れつつあった、美しい吸血姫の姿を確認する為に。
