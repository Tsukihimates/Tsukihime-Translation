<Page1>
A rumbling cage of cold air.
A square world, expanding and converging.
The transparent walls have already turned muddy black.
The deafening roar coming from inside sounds like the cry of a creature on the verge of death.
<Page2>
...I can't take it anymore.
Even I can see how much of a reckless endeavor this is.
<Page3>
"Noel-sensei!"
"Shiki-kun!? No way, you really came!?
Awawa, no, go back above! Ciel-san told me to turn away any outsider who comes here!"
<Page4>
"I can't go back now!
More importantly, what on earth is that?!"
<Page5>
"It's as you can see! It's to seal the whole area with Vlov inside, but it's not working at all!
Help isn't coming, and the sun just came down, it wouldn't be so bad if we just ran away, but that girl said that she would somehow take care of it herself.//There's a ったら, if someone can make it clearer.
Vlov came out, and she compressed the Cathedral with him inside to this size before jumping in there! That was an hour a ago!"
<Page6>
"―――!"
So it really is Ciel-senpai and that vampire inside.
To sum up, Vlov emerged to the surface, and to avoid damage to the entire surrounding area, Senpai took the snap decision to lock him in that cage and to go inside it as well.
<Page7>
I can imagine that if this cube-shaped thing isn't here, the city would have been covered by the same blizzard I saw underground. That's also what Arcueid said.
<Page8>
"But why is Senpai also inside?!
If he's imprisoned, then she doesn't need to go in, right?!"
<Page9>
"No, she needs to! This barrier was made to contain Vlov's pollution, not to contain Vlov himself! There needs to be someone inside to kill him!"
<Page10>
"W-Wha―――Then, does that mean that Senpai can't come out unless she defeats him?!"
<Page11>
"Yes, that's right! But that's impossible! Impossible, impossible, impossible! To fight off one of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors head-on is impossible, even for her! And it's already miraculous that she can take on that curse by herself!"
<Page12>
Noel-sensei is thrown into a state of panic.
For someone much more familiar with vampires than myself to be so shaken shows how serious the situation must be taken.
<Page13>
"Shit...!"
I stare at the walls of the cube.
I could guess what's happening inside, but beyond the black blizzard is an entirely different world.
<Page14>
The interior of the 40 meter box seems to be, in fact, larger than this crater.
A box where time and space are distorted.
Wherein Senpai is fighting all alone against that monster.
<Page15>
"...is winning. Senpai isn't losing, and yet...!"
She is heroic and unyielding.
She isn't retreating a single step to her opponent.
But the blizzard is weakening Senpai. It's what lives and thrives in that environment that is abnormal.
<Page16>
...In a normal situation.
Without creating that box, without a care that the cold waves would propagate, even if she fought by herself, she would definitely never lose. And yet...!
<Page17>
"......Ugh!
I grit my teeth in frustration.
The situation is too stark.
Her body has sustained too many wounds.
Ciel-senpai alone isn't able to defeat that vampire anymore.
She needs some backing, just one person... no, just one hand, just a little bit will do.
<Page18>
I remove my glasses. I stare at the enemy and the barrier.
Even though killing Vlov is impossible to do for me alone, I could at least become a weapon for her, yet...!
<Page19>
"Ouch...!"
The tip of the finger I unconsciously extended towards the wall is instantly frozen.
...It won't work. There's no way I can get inside.
<Page20>
Remember when you approached Vlov underground.
Humans can't function properly in extreme cold. Blood freezes. Cells die. Above all, the brain perishes. Humans are far too weak to stand up against vampires.//壊死 Cells necrotize, undergo necrosis
<Page21>
"...!"
And, I was already too late.
<Page22>
The shadows inside the blizzard overlap.
A spear is thrust with tremendous power,
Towards the young girl in armor whose movements have become sluggish.//I reversed line 2 and line 3
Like a crucified criminal.
The shadow resembling Senpai slams into the <extremity of the world|w a l l                >.
<Page23>
―――Senpai's end is the end of this world.
"R-R-R-Retreat, retreat! Ahhh, but we won't make it in time now! I'm gonna be frozen in ice too!"
―――With her collapse, the Cathedral disintegrates.
<Page24>
―――The world freezes over.
―――Cold waves of up to 160km/h freeze everything.
―――In the midst of it, I see Senpai bouncing around like a trash bag.
―――I could do nothing but passively look.
<Page25>
"...No, that's wrong...!"
It's not yet over.
Certainly, the cold air all around me is in negative temperatures.//negative temperatures territory?
But I'm warm. Different from the outside air, I feel a heat coming from inside my body like it's protecting me.
<Page26>
I open my eyes and look up at the sky.
The cold waves don't reach the city.
The fiercely billowing cold waves are contained to this crater.
<Page27>
And, high above on top of a building, I see Arcueid with her hand raised and a look on utmost displeasure on her face.
<Page28>
"She...!"
I break into a wide smile from happiness.
The ground is frozen and the temperature is below 40℃. Despite that, I'm still able to breathe.
The apparent temperature too may or may not have reached zero degree. If so, then even a human like me should be able to endure it a few minutes...!
<Page29>
I'm sure this is the most she could concede, in her own way.
Even if she hasn't help Ciel-senpai, she kept her promise. Because even though it just contained Vlov, she still protected us and the city.
<Page30>
"In that case...!"
The rest is up to me.
I'll save Senpai. I'll kill him right here.
Considering the situation, I sense that the two are synonymous.
I―――
C:>Look at Ciel-senpai.
C:>Look at Vlov.
