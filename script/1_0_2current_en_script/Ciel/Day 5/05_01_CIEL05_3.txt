"..........."
...I am conscious.
Waking up because of the sultry and suffocating atmosphere,
there is utter darkness all around me.
<Page2>
"...Ugh... where... am I?"
At any rate, it's cramped.
I'm stuck in a push-up position.
I can't stretch my legs or move my hands that are sticking out below.
My back is hurting. Actually, between the arms, from my groin up to my chest, I could feel something soft, warm, and squishy rustling around.
<Page3>
"Oh, you're awake? Tch, too baaad. It would have been nice to stay like this a little while longer."
"Noel-sensei...!?"
<Page4>
"Ah, don't try to stand up. This strange, surely god-blessed balance we're in will be broken."
I could hear Noel-sensei's voice coming from right under me.
We're really really close...
<Page5>
"P-Please don't put your fingers on my neck!
And your legs, your legs are between my legs!?"//I think that was the original meaning?
<Page6>
"I don't have a choice, so bear with it ♡.
I hastily erected a barrier, that's why I could only make a hole for one person. If I don't stick to you like this, Shiki-kun, you'll be crushed to bits, you know. Or is that what you want?"
<Page7>
I grasp the situation from what she told me.
Just before I were engulfed by the debris, I laid Noel-sensei on the ground and covered her with my body.
...From the start, I expected to die here.
And yet, the fact that I'm still alive...
<Page8>
"Noel-sensei, were you the one to save me?"
"Of course. I'm an executor of the Church, so I've gotten over this kind of tough spot like three times before."
<Page9>
Noel-sensei says proudly.
An executor of the Church... Then, is being a teacher just a disguise?
She's assigned to the school three days ago. So, from the very beginning, she's in the city...to kill Vlov?
<Page10>
"...But why our school? It wasn't necessary, being a teacher I mean."
"Isn't that like a cover identity? Well, considering who our opponent is, it's more convenient to blend into the city life."//Could also be 'Isn't that like superheroes hiding their identities?'
<Page11>
"No wonder that you weren't acting like a teacher at all.
Ah... and what about Ciel-senpai?"
"Her?# She's an expert executor. Her objective is the extermination of vampires. After this assignment is done, she'll head to the next one, you could say she's like a wandering transfer student."
<Page12>
"――――――"
Even though I could have predicted it, those words stabbed through my chest like a knife.
<Page13>
...I think of the scene I saw earlier.
It's fine if Senpai isn't the Senpai that I know.
I don't care if she's one of those executor guys or if she's a human who lives in the same world as vampires.
<Page14>
Because the Senpai I saw earlier is just like the Senpai I know.
On that rainy night, on the threshold of death, she's someone who reached out to me. My gratitude for her won't change, no matter how much distant the world she lives in is.
<Page15>
...But, that's exactly why.
'Her objective is the extermination of vampires'
'After this assignment is done, she'll head to the next one―――'
Even with all that's happening, those words caught my attention.//Even in the middle of all of this
<Page16>
"Shiki-kun? What's wrong, not enough oxygen? In that case, why don't I give you air, directly from my lungs?"//It's supposed to be playful and teasing
Hearing my name brings me back into focus.
Now isn't the time for such things.
<Page17>
"I've got enough air, I'm fine... Umm, you said a one-person hole, are we still inside the rubble...?
<Page18>
"Yes. Since you came to help me Shiki-kun, I also wanted to do my best. Or should I rather say that the safety net I brought automatically activated?
Either way, it's thanks to me, so praise me ,okay? That personal fortress wasn't cheap, you know?"
<Page19>
"Right. I don't know the reason, but thank you very much. You saved me once again, Sensei."
"―――O-Oh really?
Then you owe me. And I'll definitely collect my due later."
<Page20>
Noel-sensei stammers.
I somehow feel her body temperature rising. Because our bodies are in such close proximity, both of us can tell when something, even small, changes.
<Page21>
"...Umm, do you know what's going to happen now?"
"What do you mean, the room collapsed and everyone was buried alive, no?
The Dead have probably been crushed but a Dead Apostle wouldn't die from something like that... Maybe he's sleeping right now. He'll recover by nightfall."
"Vlov isn't dead... What about Senpai?"
<Page22>
"Her? That girl is even tougher. She surely made a hole like this and escaped.
More importantly, Shiki-kun, you said that Dead Apostle is named Vlov, right? Do you know him?"
<Page23>
"...I do. I met him at the hotel yesterday."
"Ahh, I see. So that was it. I was wondering why you were here, but it's because you were captured by him and dragged down underground."
<Page24>
I fake a vague reply to Noel-sensei's words.
...It would be embarrassing considering our situation to say that I came here to kill Vlov.
<Page25>
"Well, you saved me so I won't insist.
And we're still alive even though the whole thing ended strangely. That girl will take care of the rest, so let's stay like this for now."
<Page26>
"Eh... Stay like this for now...?"
<Page27>
"It will be okay. Japan's search and rescue is outstanding. If we can hold for two days, I'm sure they'll find us. Or... Fufu, is staying in that position even half a day too hard for you?"//I'm taking propositions to render うふふ well, as a seductive, teasing light chuckle.
<Page28>
Noel-sensei's fingers slither around the back of my neck.
W-Well, that's not wrong, but also not right!
<Page29>
"No, I'm talking about Vlov...!
Aren't you worried, Sensei?! That monster is going to roam the streets again once it gets dark, right?!"
<Page30>
"Probably, yes. He's one of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors, isn't he?
That means he's not someone who'll be incapacitated just by a rockfall like this. When dusk falls, the surface will, at best, cry in agony, and at worst, be entirely encased in ice."
"Then...!"
<Page31>
"'Then we don't have the time to stay like this', is that you want to say?
Please, don't be so full of yourself. The enemy is one of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors, he's a big shot that even the Church has to turn a blind eye to.
They're not even living beings anymore. They're monsters that use their Concept as a weapon. Curses that erode reality. They're glitches of the world that scramble up humanity's long-established and stable physical laws."
<Page32>
"Not even the person who taught you about Ancestors told you that?
The Twenty-Seven Ancestors are said to be similar to countries. A single person cannot defeat a whole country. So normal people can only hide and wait until they leave.//added って, said to be
Do you understand? He's never an opponent we could do anything about. Even the idea that we should be thinking about doing something is too much for us."
<Page33>
"Ugh... but earlier, Senpai said she had no choice but to defeat him during the day!"
"Again, someone who says that kind of thing is just the same as them.
That girl is special. Don't you think it'll be a good match if she's equipped to exactly counter him? Well, this time around was just supposed to be a preliminary investigation, so she only had simple equipment."
<Page34>
"........"
...Right, Senpai said something of that sort too.
So... could she kill that monster if she had proper equipment?
<Page35>
"That's why us, normal people, should just wait for help like we're doing right now. Isn't that an admirable task, Shiki-kun?"
"S-Sensei...! Are you putting your lips on my neck!?
W-Woah!? W-Wait, are you removing the buttons of my shirt, bu-!"
<Page36>
"I'm removing them, yes? As your teacher, I have to examine that you're not injured, wouldn't you say, Shiki-kun? Haha, being a teacher has its plus-plus ♪."//I tried to keep the musicality of the 役得役得
<Page37>
Now you're a teacher!?
Argh, who cares about that, this is really bad!
Even though it's not at all the time to do this, we're so close and my head pounds when I breathe in Noel-sensei's scent...!
<Page38>
"There, I'll put your glasses for you. I've stared at you a lot since you lost consciousness, so I've had my fill of your bare face ♡."
"I lost consciousness...? How long did I sleep?!"
<Page39>
"Mmm, around three hours? It should soon be dark aboveground.
So, it's already too late to do anything. Please let it go and wait for help here."
<Page40>
"Ugh...!"
I put strength into my protruding arms, and brace my legs trying to push up the lump of earth pressing on my back.
...However, there's not a chance I can free myself with that.
With my strength, I can't break out from this mass of earth.
<Page41>
"...Hoooh. Even with that, you're not blaming me, and you're very reasonable. I may be falling for you for real. I'm putting you on my list."//Falling for you could be too strong here
<Page42>
I can hear her sweet voice coming from right below.
...Far from her previous light-hearted tone, her voice is feverish and resolute.
<Page43>
"―――Sen... sei."
"This place is a bit lacking but... do you want a taste of depravity?"
I can't tell by her voice is joking or serious.
When I was going to reply,
<Page44>
"Eh? Rescuers, really? Isn't it too soon?"
The strong pressure on my back is removed like a tatami lifted up.
<Page45>
"...Please hurry up and come out, Noel-sensei.
And, Tohno-kun too, I guess, while you're at it."
<Page46>
There.
Holding up a several meters long boulder with only one hand, is Ciel-senpai who came to help us out.
