"Haa, haa, haa, haa―――!"
I slice through the lock on the rooftop door with my knife.
However, I can't find anything resembling an elevator on the top floor.
<Page2>
'Crap, crap, crap, crap...!'
I dash down the stairs, relying on the emergency lights.
Even though I'm about to descend into that cold wave―――into the midst of that vampire's rampage, my fear has fallen silent.
The reason is obvious. I'm currently, at any rate, frustrated, sad, and irritated...!
<Page3>
'That Arcueid, 'weeded out without at fuss', how can she says such...!'
I feel like screaming at my own misunderstanding.
So she's that kind of being.
She's neither a fool nor a bad person.
She's a non-human creature who lives on a different set of values from us,
That's why―――I was the bigger fool to be hoping for human common sense from her.
<Page4>
"Still―――I wanted to hope so much, shit!"
...Wasn't she the one who forgave the murderer, Tohno Shiki?
I wanted to think of her as special.
In spite of everything, I can't hate that woman, whose smile is pure beyond belief.
<Page5>
Even though I wanted to think of her as a good person so much, more than ever before―――!
<Page6>
"Haa―――Haa, haa, ha―――!"
But it's already in the past. Now's not the time to wallow in sentimentality.
I have to get to the ground below as soon as possible.
I'll make sure that Ciel-senpai is safe.
And on top and that―――I will cut Vlov's 'lines'.
<Page7>
I reach the elevator.
I press the button to the first floor.
I don't have the time to hesitate anymore.
In the first place, I'm not in a situation where I can hesitate.
I take a deep breath. I check over my body... No issues. My entire body is functioning properly.
<Page8>
I say this once again, but I'm not afraid.
I won't hesitate to kill beings shaped like humans.
I threw away such innocence in the underground tunnels.
<Page9>
"Haa――――a"
My breathing quickens.
My heart is racing like it's a separate part of my body, thumping repeatedly.
<Page10>
...I reach the first floor.
I can't rely on Arcueid.
I once again grasp my knife and run into the crater where the cold waves are swirling around.
<Page11>
A massive cubic hole in the world.
That's my impression of the abnormality in front of me.
<Page12>
A transparent box more than forty meters long across its side.
Its material is reminiscent of acrylic.
The bluish black hue isn't the color of the wall, but comes from what is stuck inside.
<Page13>
Small rocks are violently flung off all over the box.
A row of fang-like ice pillars.
Inside is a hell of extreme cold beyond human comprehension.
<Page14>
This isn't a box. It's a cage.
Something that shouldn't exist in this world.
A cage sealing a being that must not be released unto the surface.
Inside is―――
<Page15>
"Senpai...!"
She's there. Ciel-senpai is inside there.
Inside that intense cold, where even breath freezes.
She's fighting against the vampire, all alone.
<Page16>
Extreme cold approaching negative 100℃.
An extraordinarily low temperature that has never been reached on this planet's surface.
In the midst of a cold that precludes the survival of all plants and animals, two knightly figures are clashing.
<Page17>
One knight is the source of this curse, Vlov Arkhangel.
The other is a young female executor wearing <armor|a n  i n s t r u m e n t  o f  t o r t u r e     >.
<Page18>
My whole field of vision is blocked by the blizzard.
Footsteps wobbled by icy torrents.
Ice projectiles and bullets are colliding in this extreme situation where even breathing can lead to death, 
It's been an hour since their battle has begun.
The duration of this fight itself is already a miracle.
<Page19>
A catapult making 7.62mm sparks fly.
Large caliber bullets that could be considered overkill on the battlefield are released on the vampire.
<Page20>
This isn't a force intended to injure soldiers and render them unable to fight, as characterized by 8mm or 9mm calibers.
This is a modern anti-vampire weapon, made for the purpose of blowing away flesh and steel.
<Page21>
Its name is '<Death by Immolation|B l a z e           >'.
This is the exclusive Mystic Code of the executor Ciel, a branch of the scripture holding the Seven Causes of Death.
<Page22>
However. Even the rain of bullets that would normally thoroughly make minced meat of a... decade-old Dead Apostle for example... doesn't reach that vampire.
To the bullets answers the cold air.
To the modern weapon answers the violence of the planet.
Their current armament truly is a confrontation between civilization and nature.
<Page23>
The vampire doesn't move.
That incredible cold is a hell called forth from by the delusions of his mind.
The delusion that 'without blood, one freezes to death'.
It is precisely the curse that made Vlov Arkhangel into the undying being he is. 
As long as the curse binds him to the cold, he cannot move freely in this situation of extreme cold.//ruby dots <寒|・><さ|・><に|・><縛|・><ら|・><れ|・><る|・>
Until he takes in the warmth of blood, he is no more than a 'poison' defiling the earth.
<Page24>
That being said―――
A curse that covers an area as large as a city cannot bring forth such a cold.
This situation is the product of the will of the executors.
This is the result of sealing and compressing a vampiric curse extending over four kilometers in diameter in a forty meters wide square box.   
<Page25>
In a sense, it could be said that this barrier is the body of the executor herself.
As though the girl, with her body alone, is enduring the cold waves assaulting the city.
<Page26>
The cold temperatures assailing her don't stop at negative 100℃.
They reach local lows of negative 273℃, below which there is nothing.
A cursed torrent that would ordinarily freeze anything in an instant.
Defending against this, is the torture instrument made of lead and iron clinging to the girl's body.
<Page27>
The creaking armor.
Just as the vampire's taint is bending the laws of physics, this armor too, conceptually woven, stands outside of physical laws.
<Page28>
It was once a coffin referred to as Iron Maiden.
An instrument of death that pierces with countless needles the person inside.
<Page29>
'If you want to prove your innocence, then place yourself inside.
If you survive, it means you are a witch. If you die, it means you were human.'//The word was 魔女
<Page30>
It was the product of the Dark Ages, perfected as an object of terror that stole the lives of numerous people on the basis of this saying.
<Page31>
'But do not grieve. For the result is the same for all.
Because whether a witch or human, the chosen will never know freedom until death beckons.'
<Page32>
Those encased in this coffin may only reach freedom through their own death.
Once they become the target of this failed delusion, the sacrifice is trapped until death.
<Page33>
A cursed iron dress.
A Conceptual Weapon made only for inflicting pain of the sacrifice.
But. She instead uses that characteristic to her own advantage.
<Page34>
'The wearer cannot take it off until death.'
And reversely,
'The wearer cannot be <taken off it|b r o k e n    > until death.'
This is the meaning of that characteristic.
<Page35>
Only death from internal weakness, and not death from an external force, can break this coffin armor.
<Page36>
This is probably the same for this extreme cold.
Any environment, no matter how terrible, will bend the knee to this protection. For there is no greater torment than the one within.
<Page37>
Its name is thus Torture Instrument: <Proof of Purity|V i r g i n  P a i n     >.
A Mystic Code originating in death by weakness, or death by torture.
As long as the user hasn't depleted her magical energy and hasn't died being proven to be a witch, the <purity|p r o t e c t i o n> of the Holy Maiden will provide the bare minimum needed to ensure survival―――!  
<Page38>
"―――What a tremendous consumption of Od.
Speaking in terms of undying body, this is superior to that of a Dead Apostle, woman".
<Page39>
A voice echoes inside the white darkness.
The vampire, who had been silent since he appeared on the surface, seems to have finally opened his eyes, not because he was irritated by the cold, but because of the tenacity of the woman opposing him.
<Page40>
"Yet, that too has its limit.
Even supposing you can keep on infinitely dying―――
A fight does not end until the opponent is killed."
<Page41>
"Ugh...!"
As the vampire said, there is no victory in defense alone.
Against an opponent who can be said to embody the brutality of nature in a condensed form, she, as a mere human, has no chance of victory.
Because from every direction, everything is a weapon to kill her.
<Page42>
Her entire body is struck by the rushing ice spears.
The firearm in her hand is sent flying away.
The weapon, that was supposed to shoot down the unmoving enemy, sticks into the ground like a gravestone.
<Page43>
"Well then―――You dropped your sole weapon, executor"
As if to say that the outcome of the fight had been decided.
<Page44>
"You can run to pick it up if you wish.# My spear will pierce you from behind."
The vampire also understands. That the executor's armor is special.
And that to destroy it, an even stronger concept, an even stronger curse is needed.
<Page45>
The curse of extreme cold is nothing more than a physiological manifestation of his.
Like breathing, it spreads around just by him living. Such a thing probably won't shatter that armor.
Protected by a Concept like 'Cannot break', it can only be offset by confronting it with the exact opposite Concept.
<Page46>
That too is fate.
The vampire is holding in his hand a spear, bestowed upon him by his Castle Lord, before which none can stand unbroken.
<Page47>
Even Vlov is wounded. He doesn't have spare energy to waste with futile attacks.
To ensure that his killing blow lands, he knocked down his opponent's weapon.
<Page48>
"―――Well said. For a someone reduced to being a scarecrow that can't move."
But the executor doesn't look back to her dropped weapon.
This is indeed her main weapon, but it doesn't matter even if she dropped it.
<Page49>
She is instead weighing when to replace it.
Because of the extreme cold, she knows very well that the assault rifle, with its minute machinery, would eventually malfunction.
As far as the executor is concerned, her real pick is the Mystic Code she'll call out later.//Later in italics, ruby dots <こ|・><の|・><後|・>
<Page50>
"―――In the name of the Lord, come forth, Third Cause of Death."
The girl chants unto herself.
In her current state, she has come to the conclusion that she cannot overwhelm him with her firearm.
If so, then the time has come to release her blades and fight at close quarters...!
<Page51>
The iron hammer of the holy woman bares its fangs.
It isn't only the armor and the gun that are entrusted to the girl.
<Death by Immolation|B l a z e         >. <Death by Sickness|S i c k            >. <Death by Bloodloss|B l a d e          >. <Death by Collision|B r e a k           >. <Death of Mind|L o s t        >. <Death by Torture|P a i n          >. <Death by Conviction|P u n i s h          >.
As told, the Seven Causes of Death are assigned to man by the law.
The Scripture she possesses is they materializing into weapons.
<Page52>
"[ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00][ber00]―――――――――!"
With a bestial howl, the girl runs through the white hell.
The warmth contained inside her body and the accelerating magical energy are frantically discharged.
Treading and smashing through the ice torrent, she closes in on the immobile vampire.
"Woman――――――!"
<Page53>
The sound of steel resonates.
The girl is holding in her hand a very crude cutter.
A serpentine sword shaped like the trunk of a centipede, as though guillotine blades were stacked on top of each other.
A gigantic mass made to crush and granted the name of '<Death by Bloodloss|B l a d e        >―――!
<Page54>
Gouging his chest. Severing his arms. Cutting his head.
The sword of the executor mercilessly inflicts fatal wounds.
But that doesn't determine the outcome of the fight.
A vampire is a monster with an undying body. An injury, that just kills, can be healed in the blink of an eye.//"just kills" in italics, ruby dots <た|・><だ|・><殺|・><す|・><だ|・><け|・>
<Page55>
To Vlov, a sword that has nothing to it but its weight is like an insignificant cold breeze.
For now.
<Page56>
"This... is"
Heat returns to his frozen pupils.
Sensing that the lacerations to his chest, arms, and head are 'still open', the vampire finally opens his eyes.
<Page57>
Not from anger, nor from hatred.
He is waking up from joy after being frozen for so long.
<Page58>
"Where have cast away your human ways, woman?
Isn't that a swordsmanship developed by a Dead Apostle, to kill Dead Apostles?"
"――――――!"
<Page59>
Without answering, the executor attacks once more with her sword.
But her fourth blow doesn't land.
The vampire's dead past, which until now had wandered in the cold, is revived by the ferociousness of the executor's swordplay.//剣圧
The <Dead Apostle|C u r s e      >, who was just standing there, metamorphoses into the figure of the knight who once felled his king.
<Page60>
"―――How do I know, your face says.
One of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors, Sword Monk Be'ze.
Long ago, he taught me once as well.
Looking at the era―――I see. You are the last of his disciples then."
<Page61>
The unorthodox weapons collide.
On the one hand, a spear of ice over three meters long.
On the other, the composite-convertible serpentine sword over two meters long.
Lifting and pushing out.
That is the extent of a human's physical strength considering the weight of the weapons that the two are easily handling.
<Page62>
"Ugh...!"
"Haa―――!"
<Page63>
Their abilities are evenly matched. But it is clear who is dominating.
The vampire came to his senses thanks to the girl's sword.
On the other hand, the girl's movements are getting weaker with time.
From the beginning, one side had an all too great disadvantage in this battle.
<Page64>
"Excellent. Your sword skills are equal, or even superior to mine.
But being a human is your downfall.
As expected, how many more minutes will this barrier last...?"
<Page65>
The vampire's spear roars.
The executor's sword repels it.
The sword fight beyond human comprehension continues without any indication of when it will end.
...However, the moment of reckoning is fast approaching.
The moment the girl's limbs show even the slightest sign of weakness―――
The knight will thrust his spear with all his soul right through his opponent.
