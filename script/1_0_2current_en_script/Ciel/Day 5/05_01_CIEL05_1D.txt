...I still my breathing and look around.
The Dead who are chasing us come to a stop.//It's the sound of their footsteps actually
<Page2>
The movements of the Dead are human-like but not nimble from the beginning to the end. Basically, they are sluggish.//Not consistently nimble, not nimble throughout
They only move energetically when they perceive their prey. Their range is not that wide, maybe ten meters at most.
<Page3>
...Whether they perceive by sight, hearing, or something else, there's no way for me to know unless I turn into one.
<Page4>
"...Haa. It's all good now, Sensei. I'm sorry, I was too rough.
It seems that they're gone, so let's calm down for now."
<Page5>
I let go of Noel-sensei's hand and examine my surroundings.
I actually want to curl up inside that hidden place, but I have to keep my composure now if I want to reassure her.
<Page6>
"A-Are they gone...? I-Is it safe here...?"
"...More or less. As long as we're here, I don't think we're truly safe. I just got dropped here too, so I don't understand what's happening... right, Sensei, why are you-"//The first "here" in italics, ruby dots <こ|・><こ|・>
<Page7>
In such a place... I couldn't even finish my question before I'm pinned to the wall.
<Page8>
"Noo, why isn't it safe?! Make it safe! I just came as a student counselor. When I heard about a suspicious part-time job exclusively for girls, I had to get involved, right?! It's not like me to put in extra hours, but if by chance, just by chance, I see a girl I'm responsible for get taken away in front of me, I can't leave them alone...!"
<Page9>
"Wai... Sensei...! Calm down, not so loud, not so loud!"
<Page10>
"Hey why?! That's so strange, nothing makes sense! Why is there such a place below the department store?! Why are dead bodies moving?! Why hasn't anyone found this yet?! And, and, and―――"
<Page11>
"That's strange, that's strange, that's strange!
Why are you so calm...?!"//That line in italics, ruby dots <ど|・><う|・><し|・><て|・>、<貴|・><方|・><は|・><そ|・><ん|・><な|・><に|・><平|・><気|・><な|・><の|・><よ|・>
<Page12>
Thud. She hits me on the chest with the heel of her palm.//If anyone has a better idea of what 拳骨の底 is...
She says, half-crazed and with tears in her eyes.
<Page13>
"That's..."
After all, I knew from the start that I would be going into a vampire's den.
<Page14>
"Hey, aren't you afraid!? There's so many, a whole mountain of corpses!
A proper human wouldn't stay sane! There's no way you can be used to that...!"
<Page15>
"――――――"
I have trouble breathing.
Noel-sensei's crying voice, as hysterical as it sounds, rightly points out the contradiction.
<Page16>
An impossible space.
An underground graveyard stretching out like an ant nest. Walking dead bodies.
Survivors eaten alive.
A wall of corpses piled up inside the prison.
<Page17>
Look. This is hell.
This is a darkness the living can never look straight at, nor get used to.
This is precisely because humans are rational, that they cannot maintain their sense of self here.
Sane individuals, in this kind of place, have no other choice but to become animals no more intelligent than them.//Them in italics
<Page18>
"See, that's it! I'm normal! I'm proper! It's those who are unfazed in such a place who have gone crazy from the start!"
"......"
The woman's eyes are filled with hatred.
I was going to nod my head in agreement, but I exhaled instead.
<Page19>
...After all, that's wrong.
I may not be able to express it well, but that's definitely wrong.
<Page20>
"...That's wrong, Sensei. Certainly, my case is a bit special, but please don't be so desperate.
Take a breath, calm down. You can endure this.
As much of a hell this place this, I'm sure a decent person like you can endure this."
"Eh―――?"
<Page21>
...That's right.
That's why we've been gifted with reason. Humans are rational so that they can withstand the terrifying reality.
Reason doesn't exist to be broken.
It exists to fight the things that are beyond our control; that we have no choice but to overcome. That's what I remember I was taught a long time ago.
<Page22>
...How ironic.
That's something a good-for-nothing like me never managed to do.
<Page23>
"That's why it's okay. Calm down, Noel-sensei."
"Ah... no, no way, nowaynowaynoway!
We're going to be killed here...! Just now we were saved by luck, but we're going to be killed all the same!"
<Page24>
Noel-sensei complains with tears in her eyes, but the hatred that had been there earlier disappeared.
It seems she hasn't noticed it herself that she isn't panicking anymore.
<Page25>
"Then, let's continue with that luck. Now that there's two of us, you and me. If we help each other, we'll―――"
"Uh... b-but, one or two people, that won't change anything!
After all, up until now, I was with someone else too!"
<Page26>
"Eh...?"
Up until now, with someone else...?
<Page27>
"Wait a second. I'm sorry, I forgot to ask.
In the first place, Sensei, how did you get dropped here?"
<Page28>
"W-Well... A girl in our school uniform was talking with a couple of guys wearing knitted hats... They entered the department store... ignored the no trespassing sign and went to the eighth floor, and when I stopped them to ask what they're doing, they put me inside the elevator..."
<Page29>
Her story is pretty much the same as mine.
Those two are probably working for the vampire, and their job is to bring unsuspecting people down here.
<Page30>
"And then, I was taken to that large room... The girl I was with, she acted as a decoy to help me escape."
<Page31>
"That's... it. Just before she was captured, she told me to run and call for help. S-S-Shiki-kun, what do I do?! I-I... until now, I was so scared that I forgot about her...!"
<Page32>
"So there's another person...!"
The composure I felt since I saved Noel-sensei, suddenly gave way to the tension.
<Page33>
"When was that!?"
"Just a while ago...!
Thirty minutes... no, one hour... uh, uh... huh, how long ago was it... I'm sorry, I don't know!"
<Page34>
".....!"
I desperately try to think.
What should I do?
What can I do?
In the first place, what did I come here for?
<Page35>
"―――Do you remember where that large room was?"
<Page36>
"Wait, Shiki-kun, what are you thinking? D-Do you plan to go back!? Down there!? No, no way I'm telling you! There weren't just ten or twenty zombies!
No, more importantly―――You won't make it in time, and anyway, did you even think of a way to save them?!"
<Page37>
"I don't know if I can save that girl.
...But I have to at least check if she's still alive."
<Page38>
I take a deep breath and calm myself down.
I move away from Noel-sensei and turn my gaze to where the slope continues downward... toward the end of the pathway.
What she just called 'down there'. There's a good chance that I'll find that large room when I reach the end of it.
<Page39>
"Y-You're going!? I-I won't go, I won't go!?"
"...Yeah. Sorry, Sensei. If possible, I'd like you to wait here. It's safer than going together."
<Page40>
"I-Irresponsible, that's irresponsible! You're a boy, so you protect me, right?!
In the first place, didn't you come to save me?!"
<Page41>
"...I'm sorry. That's not the case.
Here, use this."
<Page42>
I hand her my knife as a strict-minimum tool of self-defense.
Apart from me, a single weapon like that one can't possibly drive back the Dead. Still, having a weapon should bring her peace of mind.
<Page43>
"W-Wah! A knife, that's just a knife! B-B-B-B-But Shiki-kun, what about you?! Do you have another weapon?!"
<Page44>
"I'll find one somehow... Wait here for awhile, and if I don't come back, please run away without me, Sensei."
"――――――"
<Page45>
I hand over my knife to Sensei and walk away.
...I'm sorry but that's the extent of what I can do.
<Page46>
"Ahhhh wait! I'll go! I'll go so wait! Don't leave me alone! To begin with, a knife like that won't be enough! Here, I'll give it back to you!"
<Page47>
Noel-sensei grabs my arm and forcefully thrust the knife back at me. Without missing a beat, she then wraps her hands around it.
...It's her way of showing she's determined not to be separated from me.
<Page48>
"I understand. ...To be honest, I'm glad. I'm relieved that you're with me, Sensei. Now, I'll be counting on you to try to make as little noise as possible."
"Mhm... yes, I won't. Trust me, I'll follow you properly."
<Page49>
...I dragged Noel-sensei into what I decided to do.
At the very least, so that she doesn't get overwhelmed by fear, I tightly grip her hand.
<Page50>
"I-It's okay... Shiki-kun, you're courageous, aren't you?"
"No way, not at all. If things get bad, I'll run away.
...Then let's go. Be careful where you step."
<Page51>
We walk briskly on the pathway, trying not to make any noise.
I want to break into a run, but that would attract the Dead and be counter-productive.//本末転倒 is thinking mistakenly that the unimportant thing is important, and vice versa, confusing, mixing the two up.
...Holding our breaths, Noel-sensei and I make our way even deep into the darkness below.
