The white curse blows violently.
In the midst of it,
something,
even with my eyes,
I couldn't see the bottom of,
the dark hole.
<Page2>
"The Twenty-Seven Ancestors...! No way, he's one of them...!? Why is such a big name now, and of all places right here in this city...?!"
<Page3>
Senpai shouts in the middle of the blizzard.
The large room is completely frozen.
<Page4>
...Trying to exhaust his blood was a mistake. Compared to the flames from earlier, this is many times more vicious.
<Page5>
Senpai lost.
She shouldn't have exhausted that vampire.
On a full stomach, he's a foe that could be defeated in one go...!
<Page6>
"Tohno-kun, go outside! You won't last a minute here!"
"W-Well, I'll run away, but what about you, Senpai!?"
"Tch... Facing an Ancestor with my current equipment... no, be that as it may, I have to defeat him while it's still daytime!"
<Page7>
Inside the white storm, Senpai breaks into a run.
Her target is that motionless vampire, Vlov.
Maybe it's because of the pain, but he couldn't even stare at her.
<Page8>
...If so, we have a chance at victory.
If she can get close to him, or even just draw closer to him, she can still win.
<Page9>
However, the distance between Vlov and Senpai is around 30 meters.
In addition, he's surrounded by some of the surviving Dead.
There's no way I could reach him.
Even for Noel-sensei, this would be a difficult situation.
<Page10>
She sweeps away such adversity in one swing of the arm.
Five consecutive shots of a blade, thin as a needle.
In the blink of an eye, a total of ten zombies on either side of her are skewered and are brought to a stop. She quickly makes her way through them, closing in on the motionless Vlov.
<Page11>
'Victory...!'//The game makes unclear who speaks/thinks this line, Shiki or Senpai
I wonder who's certain of victory, Senpai, or I.
Vlov snaps his fingers.
The resulting fallout is ill-matched to the middle of this white storm.//Resulting fallout for 反応,
<Page12>
The Dead that Senpai brought to a stop.
The gas contained in their stomach ignites in response to Vlov's signal.
<Page13>
"Wha...!"
Covered by the blizzard and the dust, Senpai is nowhere to be seen.
Even worse, that vampire has no sense of self-preservation.
<Page14>
Already with those flames that only burn human bodies and with this blizzard, but this is even worse.//Or is it saying that the blizzard is what's worse than the flames?
What should be feared the most underground is a cave-in. If the pillars supporting the ceiling are blown off, everyone will certainly be buried alive...!
<Page15>
The cavity is collapsing.
Vlov didn't think of anything.
He just automatically attacked the approaching enemy.
<Page16>
Think. This is my final move.
I―――
C:> Rush over to Senpai.
C:> Rush over to Sensei.
