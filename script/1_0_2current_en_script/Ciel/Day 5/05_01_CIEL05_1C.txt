<Page1>
"Haa... haa... haa... ha...!"
My heart screams that I can't run any further.
My battered legs give way and I drop to my knees.
<Page2>
"Haa... aa, haa―――"
I rest my back against a wall full of cracks.
I lift my chin and exhale the heated air from my lungs.
...Finally, I'm free from all the chaos.
<Page3>
"Aaa, ahh, ah―――"
What? What? What was what, what is this place?
It's wet and slimy. It smells like oil, flesh, and blood.//粘膜
The wall gleams from the animal fat that's stuck to it.
The path slopes gently downward. It's as if one were falling to the depths of hell.
<Page4>
"Haa――― ha―――"
I strain my eyes in the darkness.
My back isn't resting on a wall, but against sturdy iron bars.
<Page5>
Iron bars. In other words, this is a prison.
As I look from this now empty passageway to the inside of the prison, I see...
<Page6>
        A one-meter long caterpillar//It should be rendered in black
<Page7>
Its limbs were torn off to make escape impossible. A lump of flesh that was long ago a living being rolls over.
<Page8>
"Ugh......!"
I feel nauseous, like I got struck in the head with a blunt object.
A red-hot chunk rises up my throat.//A chunk of vomit, a mass of vomit, a lump of vomit, what's the word?
<Page9>
This is bad. I can't give off any scent, or I get the impression that the Dead will come after me.
I bang my head against the bars to clear my mind.
<Page10>
But it's not enough.//possible text overflow
As long as I stay here, it won't be enough.
I shouldn't remain here.
I shouldn't keep looking at this hell.
Is it the mind? Is it the morals? Or is it the foundation?
In any case, the parts that make up Tohno Shiki are breaking apart.
So I have to get out of here as soon as possible.
I have to get back to the elevator, apologize to those two so that they would take me back to the surface―――
<Page11>
"Ha――――――a"
I slam my head against the iron bars in anger.
With that much pain, I force out those thoughts, thoughts that anyone would consider normal.
I want to throw up. I want to throw up. I want to throw up.
I really want to vomit at my own stupidity.
<Page12>
"...What a joke. Resolve? What resolve?"
Even now, I suppress the shivers that runs through my spine by sheer self-disgust.
I'll really go mad.
I didn't have the resolve to do anything.
I can't overlook that vampire. I'll save as many people as possible.
It's what I said before, but the moment I saw this reality in front of me, I ran away crying.
<Page13>
"Aaaa―――aaa, aaa...!"
I strike the iron bars in shame and in frustration.
How pitiful. See, how ugly I am. That's my real self. I don't have any sense of justice. That's just a feeling of superiority. 'Resolve' I said, but that's just a reflection of the vanity I felt for possessing that <weapon|M y s t i c  E y e s  >.//I think putting "Mystic Eyes" as ruby above weapon is pretty nice.
<Page14>
"..., ..., ...!"
If I make a sound, they will come.
I understand that well but I keep on hitting the iron bars.
...The lives incinerated at the hotel.
...Me, the sole survivor.
...And me, the one who caused all of this in the first place.
<Page15>
I only wanted to prove my usefulness so that I could escape the guilt.
I didn't listen to Arcueid's attempts to stop me. Because I had a way to 'kill him', I thought I could beat him.//Not sure about 得意ぶった
That I could be useful.
That I could be useful, so she would forgive me. That was the childish wish I unconsciously had.
<Page16>
"Die... Someone as puerile as me should just die right here...!"
I grit my teeth and bite down the scream that is rising from my chest.
I hold back with the tears that well up from my own hideousness.
<Page17>
...It's retribution for my foolish decision.
I accept the fact that I overestimated my strength, that I couldn't see my real self, and that I entered a vampire's stronghold with such weak resolve.
<Page18>
"Ha―――"
...After being driven to a corner by my bravado, I finally calm down.
<Page19>
"...Right. There's no escape. I'm already..."
The only thing left for me is to advance.
I tried not to look at it, but I finally stare at the inside of the prison.
I observe the human corpses embedded in each of the walls.
...Even if it's a shallow decision, I burn into my brain the reason I came here.
<Page20>
"...This is no time to be scared.
The time for that probably ended yesterday night, Shiki."//Do we keep the Shiki?
<Page21>
...You can call me a hypocrite.
If I can't get rid of the guilt I feel from being the sole survivor, then I'll carry it with me forever. And I'll use this ugliness to the very end if it can push me through this hell.
<Page22>
I don't have any other straw to cling to.
Taking advantage of the <emotions|l i e   > inside of me, I finally move my numb feet forward.
<Page23>
I walk on the hard stone path.
Maybe because my eyes have become accustomed to the darkness, my surroundings become clearer to me.//Had to make more explicit
<Page24>
The stone making up the pathway is slightly phosphorescent.
On the wall are also marks of torches.
...That's not something I want to think about, but apparently, the ones who live here have the habit of lighting up at night.
<Page25>
The path continues on and on.
The road looks straight but actually curves.
The inside of the prison is dotted with side paths, but because they are made to be absolutely identical, it's also very easy to get lost.//方向感覚もままならない
The only indication is the inclination of the floor.
Anyway, I decide to make my way further in by heading down.
<Page26>
"...This road... isn't it going in a circle?"
It could be a long corridor.
I get the impression that there's a circular space on the other side of the wall, and that I'm just circling around it.
<Page27>
If the elevator stopped at the first basement floor, then# I must have gone already several floors deeper.
<Page28>
"―――!"
I'm sure that I heard the sound of the wind right now. But there's no way that the wind can blow on this pathway. Someone made that noise. Like a muffled human voice. No, like air coming out of the throat of a human-like being.
<Page29>
"They're here... Just ahead, the Dead."
I swallow the saliva in my mouth.
With one hand taking out the knife in my pocket,
the other reaches for the temple of my glasses.
<Page30>
"Ha―――――, aa"
There's no way out. There's no way out. There's no way out.
I tell myself again and again.
I know how reckless going against a vampire is.
...That being the case, I have to move on from that.
With my left foot petrified, and with all my strength, I...
<Page31>
"Aaahhh, enough, disguuuuuuuuuting!"
"!"
<Page32>
Determination and instinct. I don't know which one came first.
But my gut feeling won over my fear.
That was a woman's scream coming from the end of the pathway.
<Page33>
"Ha――― ha, ha―――!"
I run across the greasy, slippery path.
I emerge from the cramped road into an open space.
I look around and immediately grasp the structure.
<Page34>
It's a large room with a diameter of six meters and slightly less than two meters high.
There.
There is a figure of a human still alive, driven to the edge of the wall by the Dead.
<Page35>
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
<Page36>
 ―――My thoughts can't keep up with the information I'm getting.
The woman is someone I know.
I don't have the time to ask her why she's here.
The woman, Noel-sensei, is only one meter away from being eaten by the Dead.
<Page37>
"Ugh―――, haa―――!"
I don't stop running.
Because the Dead are surrounding her, they have their backs turned to me.
The distance between us is four meters. I have two seconds left to get close.
<Page38>
I won't make it in time. Can I make it in time?
I put my hand on my glasses as I run.# I lift the knife to my chest. ―――The lines of death.
Sure enough, I can see it on their necks.
<Page39>
To save, I have to kill.
The only way to save her is to kill them.
<Page40>
"...!!!!"
It fell.
The knife that was supposed to cut their necks changed target and suddenly nose-dived.//Added suddenly
<Page41>
Instead of going for the neck and ending their 'dead life', I went for the line on the arm that was reaching for Noel-sensei.
That wasn't my intention.
It was the reason of the person known as Tohno Shiki who abruptly stopped thinking.
<Page42>
"Shit―――shit, shit, shit―――!"
How pathetic can I be?
<Page43>
Just because the enemies are monsters, just because they're dead, can I simply 'kill' them and be done with that?
That's just the theory, say that when you can actually kill them!
Whether they're living or dead, it doesn't change anything.
<Page44>
The fact remains that it's 'killing a living being that shares the same form as me'.
I didn't realize that it would be so nauseating that it dulled the edge of my knife.
<Page45>
"No way, Shiki-kun!?"
"Sensei, over here...!"
<Page46>
I slip past the Dead who are looking back at me and grab Noel-sensei's arm.
The remaining arm extends as if chasing after their fleeing prey.
I slide my knife through the lines of its swollen arms.
<Page47>
"Eh, wai-, what was that? A knife? Are you cutting them with a knife!?
I mean, are you really Shiki-kun!? I'm not dreaming right!?"
"Just come here! We're running away!"
<Page48>
The moment I grasp Noel-sensei's hand, I leap into an immediately adjacent pathway.
"Hii... They're chasing us, they're chasing us...!"
The sound of footsteps echoes behind us.
I run so as to shake them off.//Is 振り払う about the noise (so that he doesn't think about them, dismiss the thought from his head) or about the pursuers (shaking them off, distancing them)?
<Page49>
As I run, I hold back the urge to vomit. I desperately choke down the feeling in the hand holding my knife... This is the result of cutting off just the arm of the Dead. If I cut off its head at that time, I might have been too shocked to move.
<Page50>
"Haa, haa, ha...! Faster! If they catch up, they'll kill us, they'll kill us!"
"Urgh, Sensei, don't panic! And keep it down! If you make noise, it'll attract the other zombies!"
<Page51>
"It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...! Please don't grip my hand so hard, no! Hold it more tightly! Drag me, I can't run anymore, I can't run anymore! Help me, help me, help me, help me!"
<Page52>
Noel-sensei continues to scream as she runs.
In this situation, it's no wonder she's becoming half-crazed.
Me too, I've thought many times about letting it end; that'd make everything so easy.
But still―――
<Page53>
"I don't want tooo, I want to go home! Call a taxi, a taxi! And buy a pudding at a convenience store!"
What's with that tantrum, that's not mature at all!
<Page54>
"Ahhhh enough, shut it!
I'll buy you some later, so bear with it now!"
"Ummhmh!?"
<Page55>
I line up with Noel-sensei, pull her tight with my left hand, and put a finger in her mouth. It's purely a way to prevent her from speaking, since if I cover up her mouth, she won't be able to breathe.
Obviously, she bites me as hard as she can.
Her teeth sink into the knuckle at the base of my finger.
<Page56>
"...!# ...#,# ...#!# ........#!!!"
"O-Ouch...! I'm the one who wants to cry! Whatever, just run!"
<Page57>
I hid myself in a byway while carrying Noel-sensei who kept struggling and floundering.
