"Huh————In the end, it would have been fine just with you, Senpai"
As I roll over on my back, I let my emotions out, part frustration, part pride. 
My heart and lungs scream of joy. 
I finally resume breathing, after having stopped a long time ago.
<Page2>
My body can't move anymore.
It's not even clear to me whether I'm still gripping my knife.
What I do feel is the pain inside my head, and the sense of falling into the darkness, as soon as I relax.
<Page3>
Like I'm under anesthesia, I don't feel the pain of the ice prickling my left shoulder. 
Nor the bleeding of my mangled limbs.
To alleviate my headache, I manage to put on my glasses, but it's no use, it's like I've been completely cut off from power.
<Page4>
"Tohno-kun...! Hold tight, are you still alive...!?"
...I hear Senpai's voice.
I don't want to make her worried, so I try to raise a hand to show her that I'm fine, but I can't move even a single finger.
<Page5>
"Tohno-kun, Tohno-kun...!
He————He's breathing. His heart is beating as well... And yet he's not waking up, ahh, maybe his head is...!"
<Page6>
"No, umm, I get the feeling you'll say outrageous"
"...!"
Maybe because Senpai helped me up.
But blood ebbs from my brain, and it seems I'm able to speak.
<Page7>
"I'm glad..!# W-Wait, I'm not glad, you're in such an awful state! That was too reckless, why did you do such a thing!?"
<Page8>
Senpai is getting angry at something that's already over. 
It's seems that she's really flustered. A shame that I can't see it properly because my eyes are clouding over.
<Page9>
"...It was. As you say, it was completely reckless, Senpai.
I was really————— incredibly, afraid."
I let up a big sigh.
<Page10>
"...Gosh. Saying such a thing now of all times, what am I going to do with you?"
<Page11>
"You said you were scared, but how scary was it really? As much as, like the rumors say, your sister?"
<Page12>
"...I see what you're doing so please don't tease me. I don't want that to happen again. And, please stop treating me like a child."
I protest with a pout.
<Page13>
As if to say she was sorry, Senpai increasingly,
"Fine. It's cute when you pretend to be tough#"
Ah, she's breaking into a sweet laughter.
<Page14>
"Ugh————"
The pain in my shoulder rips through my nerves.
<Page15>
"Awawa...! I'm so sorry, I should have healed you first!
Your shoulder is... The bone isn't broken. Good, that means even I should be able to heal it. Does anywhere else hurt?"
<Page16>
"——————————"
"Yes...? Umm, Tohno-kun? Can you hear me...?"
As long as Senpai is besides me, I'm afraid of nothing. 
...I feel like those words slipped out of my mouth, and I begin to close my eyes.
<Page17>
The only thing I can still see is the moon. And I'm reminded of another person who helped and isn't here
Arcueid. What am I going to say when I see her again.
Should I protest that she didn't do what she said she would? Or should I thank her?
Either way, I imagine what kind of face she'll make, and I————
<Page18>
"...Yes, good night Tohno-kun.
Leave the rest to me and rest well".
<Page19>
The last thing I heard was a whisper like a lullaby. 
I fall into a deep slumber, the first in two days.
