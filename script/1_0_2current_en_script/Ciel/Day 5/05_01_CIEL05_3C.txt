<Page1>
I softly open the front door, and enter Arcueid's room.
"――――――"
"Geh."
<Page2>
Just a little troublesome, but Arcueid is awake. She probably figured out that I went out alone to fight Vlov.
<Page3>
"I-I'm back, Arcueid. Are you already feeling better?"
<Page4>
"Yes. Much better. I always have to set aside energy to stay cautious of my surroundings when I'm sleeping, but this time, I could fully concentrate on just sleeping, so I recovered faster... After I woke up, I wondered why I took such a risk though."
<Page5>
Arcueid's tone was biting.
...As expected, she's angry...
<Page6>
"W-Well, of course you'd be angry after that... I apologize, Arcueid. I'm sorry that I walked out without permission."
<Page7>
"You don't have to apologize. You're free to do whatever you want during the day, Shiki. It's fine as long as you come back before sunset. I don't mind either. My power came back quicker than I would have imagined, and I feel good. There's no reason for me to be angry."
<Page8>
Arcueid says with a growl.
No matter how you look at it, she's definitely angry.
<Page9>
"...I can see that's also a lie, not surprisingly...
Err, you're clearly not in a good mood."
<Page10>
"I don't understand why I'm acting like this too! Why am I so irritated!? I want to hit you! I know I'm acting strangely, so leave me alone, you idiot!"//Fix 暴れたいの
<Page11>
Letting off a hmph, Arcueid looks away and slumps on the bed.
It seems she doesn't know I sneaked out to preemptively fight Vlov. Still, her bad mood doesn't bode well.
<Page12>
"...Did you get out of bed on the wrong side? Or do you have low blood pressure maybe?"
"That's only for humans! I woke up perfectly fine!"
<Page13>
"I see. Well then, keep lying down on the bed and cool down. We'll talk when you're ready."
"I'm fine. I'm not angry so let's talk now.
―――It's about you going outside, right, Shiki?"
<Page14>
Arcueid gets out of the bed like a roly-poly toy.
She hasn't calmed down for sure, but her words were keen.
She said 'Let's talk', but it seems she already grasped what happened during teose last few hours.
<Page15>
"You're perceptive. It's as you guessed.
...I went to Vlov's stronghold. I ignored your warnings. So, for that, I'm really sorry."
<Page16>
"...Haa. It's incredible that you're still alive.
Well, I had a feeling this would happen."
<Page17>
'Oh dear', Arcueid sighs.
Somehow, it appears that me doing reckless things wasn't unexpected.
<Page18>
"...So you knew and you let me do as I wanted?"
<Page19>
"I didn't think you'd actually go though.
You never once said 'I won't attack his castle'. That's how I knew that possibility was on your mind, Shiki.
After all, you forget a lot of things but you don't seem to be able to tell a lie."
<Page20>
"————"
For a moment, I'm stunned by how spot-on she is.
It's as if she saw through my true nature, one I wasn't even aware of. That's kind of frightening, and kind of embarrassing...
<Page21>
"W-Well, in that case, it'll be quick.
From now. I'll talk without hiding anything. Think of it as a report I'm giving you."
"Yes, go ahead. I'll gladly lend an ear to your precious information." 
<Page22>
...And thus, I speak of my experience in that underground place.
Of the corridors spreading under the department store.
Of the herd of zombies. Of the large hall. Of Vlov who appeared there.
My recounting is proceeding well up to now. Arcueid is calmly listening. But...
<Page23>
"An executor,# you say?"
<Page24>
That changes when I broach the subject of Senpai and Noel-sensei.
This is unlike the vague grumpiness from earlier.
Arcueid really has a strong dislike for executors.
<Page25>
"W-What? Is it something to get so angry over? I mean, they share our objective of defeating Vlov, and even more, they're incredibly reliable. Like Senpai made short work of Vlov's fire.
...She may even be as strong as you."
<Page26>
"Hmph. You must have been very scared, Shiki. But there is no executor or whatnot that is stronger than me.
I wasn't angry in the first place. This is just a bit unpleasant. You wouldn't want to hear about cockroaches while you're eating, right?
Enough, don't talk about them please."
<Page27>
"'Cockroaches', that's just wrong.
Senpai and Sensei are both good people, you know?! They've saved me so many times!"
<Page28>
"W-Whaaat, now you're siding with them!
And I even help you too! Shouldn't you rather rely on me?!"
"Haaa!?"
<Page29>
...I was stupefied by her unexpected reaction.
Well, I'm relying on Arcueid too, but that's not comparable to Senpai.
<Page30>
"........."
"........."
...The atmosphere gets strangely kind of awkward...
I clear my throat to forcibly change the mood.
<Page31>
"A-Anyway, Vlov is weakened.
For now, he's buried underground, but when he crawls out at night. So, before that happens, we must―――"
<Page32>
"Kill him. Defeat Vlov before he emerges and replenishes his blood, that's what you want to say. It's a good plan. It also lines up with your wish not to have any human casualties."
<Page33>
"But I won't. Will you go fight him if you're alone?"
<Page34>
"Haa!? But the plan is good, isn't it?!"
And in the first, wasn't it you who said I should rely on you?!" 
<Page35>
"Those are two different things. I don't have any interest in Vlov anymore. The executors are here, right? So leave it to them. I don't think you and I need to spend any time on this."
<Page36>
"What do mean you don't have any interest in Vlov?!"
"It's a question of efficiency. I felt like fighting against Vlov because there isn't anyone apart from me who could defeat him.
But if the executors deal with him, I don't have to step out.
I'd like to preserve my power too, and this will also take the edge of the executors' fighting strength. There you have it. There's really no reason for me to lend a hand."
<Page37>
"Guh... That makes sense...!"
I'd very much like to object, but looking at it from Arcueid's point of view, it's a reasonable.
<Page38>
After all, Senpai and those like her are vampire hunters.
To Arcueid, they're enemies... Or if not, then at least irreconcilable opponents.
Thus, avoiding exhausting one's resources and examining the opponent's moves is an extremely sound tactic.
<Page39>
"...Then, you won't fight Vlov, no matter what?"
<Page40>
The voice that came out of my mouth is surprisingly weak.
It looks like I was relying on Arcueid more than I thought I was...
<Page41>
"...Hmmm. So that's the face you make..."
...But thinking about it, perhaps I should say that this is natural as a human being.
Or rather than just imagining I alone could somehow do something against Vlov is delusional.
Or rather than confronted with foul play, I intended to also go against the rules...//I think he's saying that Vlov is so strong it's like foul play, so he'll respond with foul play i.e. Arcueid
<Page42>
"Well, 'no matter what', you say?
I'll listen to your request, Shiki. So will you also listen to mine?"
"...What did you say?"
<Page43>
"I'm going to grant your wish, so you'll also listen to what I'll say.
If you promise, then I'm not opposed to lending you my strength."
<Page44>
"W-What did... you say?"
Unintentionally opening wide my eyes, I repeat myself a second time.
<Page45>
"I said that I'm fine with defeating Vlov if it's for you."
<Page46>
"――――――"
Her tone was a little light-hearted, but she's serious.
<Page47>
...This isn't something I can readily acquiesce to.
Once I agree, I don't know what kind of unreasonable demand she'll spring on me.
I've seen enough now to thoroughly know that she doesn't think about human lives at all.
<Page48>
"Hey, what are you going to do? Are you going to ask me for a favor?"
"Urgh..."
<Page49>
How did it come to this... I was the one who was helping her, but before I even knew what was happening, she got me to ask her for help... 
<Page50>
"―――Ah"
But that's a choice I have to make. It's give-and-take. 
I can't kill Vlov by myself.
No matter what, I can't let the tragedy of what happened at the hotel repeat again. That's why―――
<Page51>
"―――I understand. I ask of you Arcueid.
That is my request, defeat Vlov."
<Page52>
"All right, leave it to me! Let's go now then!"
"W-Wait,# don't drag me...!
What do mean 'now', aren't we waiting until late at the night?!"
<Page53>
"The executors are here, aren't they? They're quick to act, if only that.# Let's do it now before they beat us to the punch!"
<Page54>
"Beat them to it?', so what's the plan?!"
"Hmm? Vlov's curse is 'Freezing Air', not 'Flames', right?# Then it's easy. I can counter him. And in terms of compatibility, the former is more simple for me."
<Page55>
"The strategy is simple too. I'll restrain Vlov, so that you just need to kill him with your eyes.# Don't worry, me and you, we can end it in the blink of an eye!"
<Page56>
Arcueid grabs my hand, and starts to run as if she couldn't wait anymore.
<Page57>
...What an unbelievable turn of events...
Now that it's come to this, I have no choice but to go along.
The time is just past seven o'clock.
...I wonder how the situation evolved during these last two hours.
I have to believe that Vlov hasn't emerged from underground and bet on Arcueid...!
