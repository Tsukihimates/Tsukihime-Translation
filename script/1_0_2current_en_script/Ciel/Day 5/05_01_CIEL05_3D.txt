Arcueid jumps from the luxury apartment into the city, taking me with her, and ten minutes later.
As if nothing happened, we touch down on the roof of a high-rise building.
<Page2>
"Here is perfect. We can see nicely see what's happening below, right?"
Arcueid says while letting go of my hand.
<Page3>
"W-Wai―――You―――"
<Page4>
As she lets me down to the flat ground, I faintly grumble.
I felt like I shouldn't be surprised no matter what Arcueid does, but I never imagined she would carry me and spring up like a rabbit on the side of buildings.
<Page5>
"Haaa, haaa... I shouldn't have said anything about a place with a good view―――"
I calm my palpitating, thumping heart.
I take a deep breath to get over the dizziness caused by the sudden change in atmospheric pressure.
<Page6>
"But it's true that we can see the whole park from here. Next time, warn me in advance so that I can be prepa... Arcueid?"
<Page7>
"――――――"
Arcueid looks down at the city from the edge of the roof.
Even from behind, I could sense an indescribable killing intent.
<Page8>
...The situation has taken a turn for the worst.
A white mist is enveloping the whole area around the sinkhole.
The cold wave is reaching even the roof of the building.
<Page9>
Before this incredible phenomenon, the whole area has fallen silent.
Warding off people with traffic control is working. The police and fire trucks have been dispatched, but they're not approaching the area around the sinkhole at all.
<Page10>
The park has collapsed and has become a sea of rubble.
There are innumerable swords stuck in the crater in the form of a mortar.
Those are the western-style swords that Senpai was throwing.
The swords, over a hundred of them, are hammering the ground.
<Page11>
"A barrier made of a hundred Black Keys... Yes, this is the work of the executors..."
"Arcueid...?"
<Page12>
"An artificial temple created of od.
If he's a normal Dead Apostle, he wouldn't just be locked in but crushed, and it would already be over..."
<Page13>
Her voice is laced with deep-seated anger... and hate.
It's almost like the very normal aggressiveness and irritation that humans hold.
<Page14>
"Is it locking Vlov in? But..."
Almost all the swords have been frozen.
On top of that, the abnormally cold air, it must be―――
<Page15>
"No, Vlov is still sealed.
Look―――The mist is clearing up now."
<Page16>
The white wall disappears.
In the middle of this land of debris is a gigantic, rectangular ice-like box―――
<Page17>
"W-What is that...!? It wasn't there a moment ago!?"
"Hmm. It's been maybe an hour since they constructed that cage. They've spared no effort to set up such a shoddy structure, that lot."
<Page18>
In front of the huge box is a familiar figure.
It's Noel-sensei, holding a halberd.
She's moving around frantically in front of the box, sometimes moving away from it, then turning back, racking her brains. A little more and she would really turn into a headless chicken.//My best attempt of preserving the original emphasis of literally running left and right, meaning to be confused 文字通り右往左往
<Page19>
"―――Senpai isn't here―――"
...This is bad.
I don't understand the gist of what's going on, but I can already tell that this is a situation we can't step back from.
<Page20>
"Arcueid, let's go down! It has already started right!?"
Restraining my impatience, I call out to Arcueid.
The vampire at my side doesn't need me to tell her what's happening below, she already understands everything and she will...
<Page21>
"I don't want to."
"―――Haa?"
With a hmph, she turns away like an uncooperative child throwing a tantrum.
<Page22>
"What do you mean you don't want to!?
You said you were okay even with the executors."
<Page23>
"No is no. Executors are like mosquitos, but this is different.# I'd rather sleep while embracing the sun than help her."
<Page24>
In other words, she'd rather die.
I instinctively understand that the metaphor is apt, but my confusion increasingly deepens.
<Page25>
"By her, are you talking about Ciel-senpai?!"
<Page26>
"Don't say that name. And stay where you are, Shiki.
That thing will soon self-destruct. If the box is destroyed, the whole area will be covered in ice. So you'll die if you don't stay close to me."
<Page27>
"――――――"
Self-destruct? Senpai?
To begin with, if the box is destroyed, the whole area will...!
<Page28>
"The whole area, meaning?!"
"Mmmm, the entire city I'd say? Concretely everything in a ten-kilometer radius, give or take. But I won't help, not in a million years."
Arcueid doesn't even meet my gaze.
<Page29>
"'Not in a million years', what are you saying, now of all times!? Do you hate Senpai that much!? Do you have a grudge against her!?
You do, you do have one! But this has nothing to do with that! Because what we have to now is kill Vlov!"
<Page30>
"I said that I couldn't care less about her! I don't care about her, I won't care about her! Sure, it's Vlov I should kill. If I go right now, I can easily kill him.
But I won't go. Because she's someone I don't care about, so I won't do anything until there's no reason for me to care about her!"
<Page31>
"Idi―――"
Idiot. We have an idiot here.
I have no idea what their circumstances are, but she seriously has no intention to fight Vlov as long as Ciel-senpai is there...!
<Page32>
"In the first place, you only have yourself to blame for how the situation turned out.
If you didn't manage to stop Vlov alone, then there's no surprise if that puny group crumbles.
It's the natural order for weak creatures to be weeded out without a fuss, like the weak creatures they are."
<Page33>
"Idi――――――――"
Her words interrupt my thoroughly confused train of thought.
In a way, it could be said that they calmed me down.
<Page34>
"Idiot. You understand that much, why aren't you going to help?! You won't help! You don't care about humans, huh?
In the end, you're just a vampire, you blockhead!"
<Page35>
"Haaa?! It's you Shiki who doesn't get it, even after all I told you!# If I'm helping, it's for yo-"
"Fine, do whatever you want, you selfish woman! You stupid, stupid!"
<Page36>
I curse her and run to the exit of the rooftop.
I can't rely on Arcueid.
Now that it's come to this, I'll get down with my own feet, I have to figure out what's happening...!
