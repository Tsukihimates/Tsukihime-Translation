I'll take it easy in the cafeteria.
Fortunately, I'm in good shape today.
I'll order the sumptuous 'meal set A' for a change.
It's a bit expensive so I don't usually order it, but I don't have to worry about my financial situation.

After all, as of yesterday, I am the eldest son of the Tohno family.
"I want to have the most expensive meal in the cafeteria every day."
I am sure that if I suggest this to the head of the family, she would accept it with a smile.

"I see. Then, I will give you a month's worth of meal coupons.
I will also contact the school cafeteria and find out what the menu is for the month. I'll let you decide what you want to eat. Is that acceptable?"

"...Hmn?"
For some reason, I feel a chill, but I decide not to worry about it and head for the cafeteria.
I'll just enjoy the freedom to eat whatever I want.
