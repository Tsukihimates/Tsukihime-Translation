The morning class is over.
The air in the classroom is more turbulent than usual.

This is because the third period was Noel-sensei's class, and the friction between boys and girls was beginning to surface.

Anyways, it's lunchtime.
Most students have gone to the cafeteria or the school store.
In the classroom...
A group of girls, including Yumizuka, is still there.

C:>I'll buy some bread and finish it in the classroom.
C:>For now, I'll go into the hallway and think.
