I'll just take it easy and buy some bread.
My financial situation from now on is going to be tough.
The head of our family is not a playful person, so there's no hope of any extra income.
<Page2>
Therefore, I want to keep my expenses as low as possible. It would be too pathetic to be broke in the event of an emergency.
<Page3>
I go to the school store and buy some affordable bread and tea.
It is more crowded than usual because of the new products they brought in, so it took a while. The bento group has already finished their lunch and is chatting.
<Page4>
"Tohno-kun, are you going to have lunch now?"
"Yeah, it's pretty quiet, so I can take it easy here, what about you, Yumizuka-san?"
<Page5>
"I've already finished.
And so, I've got some leftover side dishes... Since you're about to eat, would you like a little side menu with your lunch?"
<Page6>
"――――――"
I observe a group of girls to make sure they don't notice me.
A few of them are gathering around and discussing the situation between Yumizuka and me.
...Whatever the reason, it is clear that Yumizuka will be teased by the girls if I refuse.
<Page7>
"I would appreciate it. Bread alone is tasteless, thank you for the meal."
I clasp my hands together and thank Yumizuka.
<Page8>
"Y-Yes, indeed, it feels lonely with only bread, right?
Here you go! Fried chicken and clams boiled in soy sauce!"
<Page9>
It's a strange combination.
The fried chicken was made by her mother, but the boiled clams were apparently made by Yumizuka. To her credit, I'll say that the taste is average.
Anyway, I think her contribution made for a spectacular lunch.
<Page10>
"Thanks for the food, it was delicious.
If the opportunity arises, I will return the favor next time."
"N-No, it's okay, today was just a coincidence!
A-Anyways... Oh right! Did you hear the gossip yesterday?"
<Page11>
"About Toyama-sensei? You mean the news from yesterday?
I've heard rumors that something awful happened."
<Page12>
"Yeah! You know, I heard that was a misunderstanding!
I heard he was involved in a car accident and broke his leg, so he had to be hospitalized."
<Page13>
"I see. That's good. Ah, no, that's not good.
If you're hospitalized because of a leg injury, it means you can't walk, right? Toyama's going to be pissed about that for sure."
<Page14>
"Ah....
Y-You're right, I don't know what I'm so happy about...
I'm sorry, I didn't think it through..."
<Page15>
Yumizuka's smile changes to a look of remorse.
But I understand how she feels.
Even if it was just a rumor, they said that he died. She couldn't help but feel relieved when she found out it was just a leg injury.
<Page16>
"Don't worry about it, I feel the same way you do.
Then again, we won't have a homeroom teacher for a while. It's going to be lonely without him."
"Yeah, I hope he recovers soon and returns."
<Page17>
I get caught up in Yumizuka's smile and my mouth loosens up a bit.
She isn't incredibly beautiful or anything, but she has a charm that makes everyone around her feel at ease.
<Page18>
Or rather, her good nature has made her a trustworthy 'advisor' in the class.
<Page19>
She's a laid-back person, but she's popular.
She was nominated as a class committee member by unspoken agreement of the class, and despite humbly saying 'I don't think I'm up to the task' she has been able to proficiently carry out the job with her natural virtue... or rather, as a result of her good character.
<Page20>
"........."
I find myself with only two minutes left until the end of lunch break.
I've heard some good news, and without that noisy Arihiko around, I think I can spend the afternoon in peace.
"........."
By the way.
Why isn't she going back to her desk?
<Page21>
"Yumizuka-san, it's almost fifth period."
"Hyah!? Ah, yeah, I know, one minute, one minute until the bell rings!"
<Page22>
"Ah. Everyone will probably go back to their seats after the bell rings, so there's still time."
"N-No, I don't know, I don't have much time, but I think now is the time to take my chances when Inui-kun isn't here, um, well!"
"?"
<Page23>
Everyone begins to take their seats before the bell. In the meantime,
<Page24>
"Well, you see!
Here, I have a spare, maybe you can use it!?"
<Page25>
Yumizuka holds out what looks like a card. This is a... family restaurant's loyalty card...?
<Page26>
"T-Thanks, but are you sure?"
"I-I've got a lot of points!
No, my friend was in a pinch, so I applied for a part-time job and the manager gave me a bunch of cards! Come eat with us when you feel like it! At seven o'clock or something like that!"
Yumizuka runs, scampering to her seat.
<Page27>
The bell rings.
"........."
I'm really happy, but I can't be honest about it.
That's because yesterday at lunch, Arihiko brought up a topic like this.
<Page28>
We had just finished talking about the Tohno family and were about to finish our lunch.
"By the way, about Yumizuka...
Hey, do you have feelings for her, or do you wanna go out with her?"
I didn't even ask for this kind of life advice.
<Page29>
"......Why are you talking about this now?"
"Well, you were approached this morning, weren't you? I was just worried is all. Yumizuka's more or less the idol of the class. If there's any chance that you have a thing for her, I'd like to stop you."
"Huh? What the hell is that? It's none of your business what I think of her."
<Page30>
"Of course not. I just don't wanna see a situation where both of us are unhappy.
She looks like that, but she's more like...
Oh well. It's certainly not for me to interfere with.
So, what do you think? Are you going to go out with her? Since she's made this many moves, you'd think she'd be your girlfriend right away, right?"
<Page31>
"...I think that would be difficult."
"Hoh, she isn't your type?"
"That's not what I meant. I'm warning you, Yumizuka-san is my type. I'll do my best to stop you if you try to take her."
<Page32>
"What're you, her dad? Why are you keeping your distance then?"
"No, that's... how do I say this, looking at her makes me sad for some reason."
"―――That's awful.
You wanna stay as 'just friends', even if she approaches you?"
<Page33>
...I can't stop thinking about my selfish thoughts.
But there is nothing I can do about it.
<Page34>
Subconsciously, I tend to avoid... people who have decent values... and whom I can respect.
It's not that I don't like them, it's more like I'm afraid to approach them.
<Page35>
"......Mmm."
I have a card that has exactly 1,000 yen worth of points saved up on it.
The name of the restaurant is Lindberg. It is a very typical family restaurant located at the north gate of Souya Station.
