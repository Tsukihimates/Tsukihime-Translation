<Page1>
As soon as I step into the hallway, I run into a familiar upperclassman.
<Page2>
"What's the matter, Senpai?
Do you have something to do in the second year classroom?"
<Page3>
"Yes, of course. It's not exactly with the second year's classroom per se, but a certain person in the class."
Ciel-senpai smiles and walks up to me.
<Page4>
"I just bought a very nice product from the school store, but I got carried away and bought too much.
I can't eat it all by myself, so I've just come to get someone who seems to be free."
<Page5>
"Oh. You've come to get someone, huh?
<Page6>
From the looks of it, no student has free time on their hands, but anyone would make time if they are invited by Senpai. In fact, there'd be a queue.
Even with all that, though.
<Page7>
"You can't come to the second year classrooms, you're an upperclassman. If you want to invite someone, please invite your third year classmates. You'll have a livelier conversation that way."
<Page8>
"That's true, but I'm in the mood to talk to a younger boy today. I just feel like it, so please don't ask me why."
Saying that, Senpai quickly closes the distance between us.
<Page9>
"That's why. Tohno-kun, are you free?
"Eh...yeah, well that's.
I'm about to have lunch, though."
<Page10>
"Gotcha then. Let's eat together in peace.
Along with a nice meal, I'd like to spend some time with you as well."
<Page11>
"------"
With a smile on her face, she pulls my sleeve with a curl of her fingers.
It is really just a small gesture, but it is filled with a mysterious coercion that I could not resist.
<Page12>
We go out to the courtyard.
The season is moving deeper into Autumn, and even though it was sunny, the temperature is chilly.
The only students eating lunch in the courtyard in spite of that are those that appreciate the elegance of the place, and Senpai seems to be among them.
<Page13>
"Oh, the benches are unusually empty today.
You're lucky indeed, Tohno-kun!"
<Page14>
Senpai sits down on the bench with a light step.
I follow her example and sit down next to her at a slight distance.
<Page15>
"So, what's this new product in the school store?
The crab cream croquette rolls that vanished a year ago?"
...There used to be a great menu like that.
It was so expensive that it was discontinued within a week, but many students are still waiting for it to return.
<Page16>
"Fufufu, well you see..."
Senpai smiles as if melting with joy, places the paper bag on her lap, and takes out four side dishes from inside.
<Page17>
"Ta-da! It's been a week since I advised the school store's stocking routes! At last! We can sell authentic bakery products!"
<Page18>
It is an oval-shaped, chunky loaf of bread that spilled slightly from the palm of her hand.
It is a deep-fried bread with a dark brown surface that glistened with oil.
All four are the same size and design.
No matter how you look at it, it's freshly fried curry bread.
<Page19>
"Good...this is as good as freshly baked...at 300 yen per piece, they are rather expensive, but it is no exaggeration to say that they are the ultimate in student luxury.
Here you go. I'll give you a special half, don't hesitate ---Tohno-kun?"
<Page20>
"...No, um. Senpai. You see."
It's the curry bread sold at the famous bakery in front of the station, right?
<Page21>
"Why?"
It's not "why".
I don't know what to say to that look she's giving me, like "Are you sure you're from Earth if this doesn't make you happy?".
<Page22>
"It was the same yesterday. ...Senpai, do you like spicy food?"
For some reason, I avoid saying "Do you like curry?"
<Page23>
"Y-yeah, well. Ah, but it's not that I like it because it's spicy, it's just that I find certain flavors very delicious...well, that's right. No matter how much I like it, all four have the same flavor. I didn't give much thought about that..."
<Page24>
Good...looks like she's aware of that at least.
<Page25>
"But I understand. If you don't buy enough of what you like, you'll get anxious.
Well then, I'll take your word for it and help myself to one."
<Page26>
I pick up one of the curry bread spread out on Senpai's lap and bring it to my mouth.
<Page27>
"Thanks for the meal...mmmmmm. The outside is crunchy, the bread is slightly sweet with a hint of oil, and the inside is packed with ingredients...yes, it's delicious. It's really delicious, Senpai."
<Page28>
I'm not used to eating this kind of food, so it feels refreshing.
I used to avoid fried bread because of its high oil content, but it is very tasty if you eat it occasionally.
<Page29>
"But, Senpai, are you going to be okay? Curry and fried bread are hard on the stomach. I think it's too much for a girl."
"I-is that so?
Let's see...I have PE afterward, so I think I can digest it without any problem, yes."
<Page30>
"......"
If it's physical education, shouldn't you choose something that's more easily digestible? I'm not sure what criteria she's basing her decision on.
<Page31>
"The only thing I have going for me is that I'm strong.
Ah, more importantly, we need tea, right? Is barley tea okay, Tohno-kun?"
<Page32>
"Aye, Japanese people always drink barley tea, right?
Whoa, snagged a leftover curry bread!"
"Kyaa~"
<Page33>
It's no wonder that Senpai is surprised.
I wonder how long he had been sneaking up on us, but he reached from behind the bench, proudly snatched a piece of curry bread, and finished it in one bite.
<Page34>
"I see, this one's good. It's really good. It tastes more like curry than anything else. It's too much of a treat for me when I just woke up on an empty stomach!
No, it's a little hard on the stomach, but the sincerity of Senpai makes it even!"
<Page35>
Hahaha, says Arihiko with a hearty laugh.
This guy saw me and Ciel-senpai together and snuck up on us...!
<Page36>
"Arihiko...why are you so good at getting in people's way? Is it a curse from a previous life? Or are you just that kind of creature?"
<Page37>
"Heh heh heh, no sneaking around, dear sir. I just can't let you enjoy something so delicious-looking alone.
If you're having lunch, why don't you let me join you? I gave up my seat yesterday, so it's your turn to give up your seat this time, isn't it?"
<Page38>
In Arihiko's mind, yesterday's lunch was "saving a seat for Senpai". It is a very convenient way of thinking.
<Page39>
"...Hah. Sorry, Senpai. Some idiot from my class was rude. I know I'm asking a lot, but he was useful yesterday, so let him sit...Senpai?"
My gaze shifts from Arihiko to Senpai.
And then.
<Page40>
"Unfortunately, your request is rejected.
Inui-kun, please stand still and clench your teeth."
<Page41>
I see Senpai nimbly stand up and take a fighting stance.
<Page42>
Senpai's left jab cut through the air with a whoosh.
"Why do you look like a professional!?"
Even to us amateurs, It was clear that this is perfect shadowboxing.
<Page43>
"S-she's angry, Arihiko. She's mad as hell over a mere bite of a piece of curry bread."
<Page44>
"O-oh, what the hell is this, I can't stop sweating, that's bad, that's really bad, the pressure is making her fists look bigger." #Ah, #I got grazed, I just got grazed on the tip of my nose, help me Tohno, do something and apologize to her!"
"You're the one who should be sorry! Get away from me, get away from me, or you'll make me a victim too!"
I pull away from the clinging Stupihiko.
<Page45>
"Whoa, as expected of you, nice sentiment! I'm sorry, Senpai, but grabbing of your food was more of a spur of the moment thing, or a flirting thing, or an attempt to have lunch with you, you know?"
<Page46>
"I see. That's what you wanted.
But I don't see any proper admission tickets. If it's lunch, shouldn't you bring something to eat?"
"Okay, got it! I'll go get something right away!"
<Page47>
Arihiko sprints away at top speed.
Ciel-senpai sits back down on the bench as if nothing had happened.
<Page48>
"I'm also troubled by Inui-kun.
Not only did he not say "thanks for the food", but he also swallowed it in one bite, completely failing to show appreciation for the food.
Well, I'll give him a pass this time, since he's put on two good shows for me.
She shrugs her shoulders and lets out a scolding typical of an upperclassman.
<Page49>
"Sorry for the wait! I've bought the tickets!"
"Oh."
"Geh."
Arihiko comes back in about five minutes.
In his hands, he is carrying two full paper bags.
<Page50>
"Oh, man, that's too much..."
"What do you think? I bought up as much as I could. ---I was hoping it would calm her down."
<Page51>
I see...that's how powerful it was.
That must have been a fear that only the person who was being targeted could feel.
<Page52>
"No, two paper bags full of curry bread is still too much. It's not like croquettes on a plate, how are you going to clean this up?"
<Page53>
"If you can't finish it, leave it. It will be fine for a while, so you can snack on it until tomorrow's lunch.
That's why, here, Senpai.
I apologize for earlier and offer to share this lunch with you."
<Page54>
"Well, well, thank you very much for your kindness.
Please come to the bench, Inui-kun. I'll just stand here."
"What are you talking about? #Please sit down, Senpai.
So, what did you guys talk about while I was gone?
Going out after school?"
<Page55>
"On the contrary, inside the school.
Since you weren't here this morning, you don't even know that a new teacher has replaced Toyama-sensei. #What a shame. She's so beautiful that the guys in our class are in a frenzy over her."
<Page56>
"This is the first time I heard of that. Does that new teacher look like a transfer student?
...So, what's she like? I'm not really into high-handed female teachers."
"She looks like she was a trainee until last year. #You like older women who are patient, don't you? Good for you. She's 25, exactly how you like it."
<Page57>
"Hold on, not 25, anything but 25! She's the same age as my sister. That's the only thing I can't physiologically accept!"
<Page58>
"Oh. Inui-kun, do you prefer older women?"
"Yes, I do. Older women are not troublesome. #Well, if she's cute I can go a year younger."
<Page59>
"Hmm hmm...so you're good at both pampering and bullying?
By the way, what about you, Tohno-kun? Do you like older women?"
<Page60>
"W-well, I've never really thought about it, but I don't think I'm as unrestrained as Arihiko though."
"Eeh. Wait a minute...that's so annoying. I don't know why, but you seem like an older women killer. Isn't there no shortage of stories about tutors and doctor's daughters and that sort of thing?"
<Page61>
"Shut up. Just shut up. I've never hired a tutor in the first place."
<Page62>
"Hoh. #So, do you know the daughter of some doctor?"
"Y-yes, but only as acquaintances!
Ciel-senpai, please don't fall for Arihiko's nonsense!"
<Page63>
"It's not nonsense thooough. It's true, thooough. In fact, you ran off and had lunch with an older student, didn't yooou?"
<Page64>
"That's right. Tohno-kun was walking so unguardedly, I was tempted to take him with me. It was like running into a rabbit in a snowfield."
"Well, he's actually a cold-blooded creature in a rabbit's skin. Spiders, scorpions, that kind of machine-like creature."
<Page65>
Senpai and Arihiko laugh at each other.
I want to object, but I'm afraid I'll end up bringing unnecessary trouble upon myself, so I stay silent.
And so, the number of curry bread dwindles.
I would like to correct my earlier comment about the croquettes on a plate. The mountain of fried bread is now being consumed like a snack.
There are less than 20 minutes left before the lunch break ends.
What will be the fate of these curry bread?
<Page66>
The conversation continues until the end of the lunch break.
Arihiko and I would talk about stupid things, Ciel-senpai would give her opinion, and the conversation would start all over again. We are also running out of curry bread.
Such a useless and quite ordinary time passes like flowing sand.
<Page67>
"Oops, I'm starting to get a headache. I'm full...no, wait, #I don't think I ate anything. I don't think I could have eaten anything... #Oh well, I'm getting sleepy, so I'm going to run to the infirmary.
See you later, Senpai, and next time just the two of us please!"
<Page68>
Arihiko runs off to the infirmary, seemingly intent on skipping the afternoon class as well.
<Page69>
"Oh well. I know I should be careful, but strangely enough, I've become lenient towards Inui-kun. Is this another human virtue?"
Ciel stares at Arihiko in exasperation until he leaves the courtyard.
<Page70>
"He does the bare minimum, right? He's the kind of guy who cleans up his own mess. I think you should trust him and let him be."
<Page71>
"I see. I have a feeling that's true.
You've known him for a long time, so you know him well, don't you?"
<Page72>
"It's just a rotten relationship. I'm sure you found that out already.
He's an idiot through and through."
Although I badmouthed him, Senpai keeps her gentle smile.
<Page73>
"...Erm. What's with the smile?"
"No, no. You're smiling, so I'm smiling along with you. We had a good time today, didn't we?"
<Page74>
"------"
I only notice my smile when she said that.
Those are certainly precious moments.
Come to think of it, I've never spent time in the courtyard like this before, contrary to other students.
<Page75>
"...Yes, it was. It was kind of fun.
I've never been out in the courtyard much. But I think I've seen something like this before. Was it when I met you?"
<Page76>
I recall the memory of the first time I met Senpai.
Senpai is...
"Yes, there have been many moments like this.
Too many to count, I'm sure."
She replies with a sincere smile.
