 Ahh....it's red, it's blood.
Because I dismembered her, that disgusting color keeps spreading around.
If so, then really, I'm the one who, with my hands...
<Page2>
"―――Stop. Stop it. Don't say it..."
But my heart is screaming.
It's like it's going to explode if I don't get the truth out, the words, down my throat...
<Page3>
No, no, no. No, no. No. No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ―――――
<Page4>
"That's wr...ong."
Don't look away. That's just wrong.
"No, I'm telling you..."
No, no, no, no, that's not it.
<Page5>
"So, why...! I don't know this person, she's just a stranger I saw on the street. ......!
That's crazy right! Why did I kill a complete stranger?!"
<Page6>
Shouting won't get me an answer.
And I know exactly why.
When I saw her, I could only think of one single thing.
<Page7>
"I..."
 Yes, I...
     I, Tohno Shiki, want to kill that woman.
<Page8>
That was all that mattered back then.
Just that my head was melting inside, just that I couldn't put into words what I was feeling.
<Page9>
"No..."
I feel nauseous.
<Page10>
"Uhhh, ughhhhh."
The content of my stomach is coming back.
Vermilion soaks into my eyeballs.
<Page11>
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!"
I run out.
I can't think about anything else.
I just want to get out of here, so I leave the unfamiliar apartment in a half-crazed frenzy.
<Page12>
My stomach acid flows back up into my mouth.
I kneel down on the ground and vomit up all the content of my stomach.
I vomit out all the food and gastric juice while crying.
<Page13>
There's nothing in my stomach.
And yet my body forced me to vomit, as if refusing to accept what had happened, as if trying to return to my normal routine.
<Page14>
It hurts.
It's like my insides are burning.
The tears won't stop, and my body crumbles to the ground like a piece of trash.
<Page15>
I killed a person.
I killed her as easily as if she were a doll taken apart, without any meaning, without mercy.
<Page16>
Why did I feel that way?
Why did I really kill her?
Even now, I still don't understand the reason.
<Page17>
"――――――"
But who cares about me?//As in, Shiki is saying that he's not important, he shouldn't think about himself but rather about the girl he killed
My heart is pierced by endless regret and self-hatred.
<Page18>
I've killed that woman.
Her whole life,
The relationship between her and the people around her,
The future she had always dreamed of, everything...
I, who had nothing to do with her, destroyed it all with a laugh.
<Page19>
Even if I feel regret, I won't be forgiven.
Even if I apologize, I will never be forgiven.
<Page20>
"I... such a"
I just want to pull my eyeballs out.
I'm not even sure if I'm still sane.
At that time, I couldn't even think of enduring or holding back.
"I'm going to kill that woman."
I affirmed it as if it were a matter of course, and carried it out.//That's the right idea, but really needs reformulation
<Page21>
Then...... the answer is simple.
I must be crazy.
I've probably been crazy for the last seven years.
Since the accident that should have killed me,
But I was miraculously revived, and from that moment on...
