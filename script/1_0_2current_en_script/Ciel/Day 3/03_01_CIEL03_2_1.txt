...I'll eat in the classroom.
However, I don't have much of an appetite today.
If I eat at a time like this, I'll surely end up vomiting, so I think I'll be better off resting in the classroom...
<Page2>
"Hey Tohno, c'mon let's get some food."
"―――"
What little appetite I have disappears when I see his stubborn face.
Okay, I'll skip lunch today. Thanks for the excuse, Arihiko.
<Page3>
"Sorry, I'll pass today. You can go on your own."
"What the hell, you're getting more unhealthy by the day!
What, is your new life as an aristocrat not suiting you after all?"
<Page4>
"You know, I'm not an aristocrat... Ah, well, maybe you're right. If I'm not considered an aristocrat, then who is?
The bathrooms in the mansion are huge, Arihiko. They're bigger than your room. And more expensive too."
"Seriously!? I'd never be able to feel comfortable with that sort of lifestyle."
<Page5>
...I take back my earlier comment.
Thank you, Arihiko, for your encouraging response.
It's a relief to hear something that I can agree with wholeheartedly.
<Page6>
"...Well, even if we're talking about the mansion itself, that's just how it is.
They complain that I'm sleeping in even if I wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning, but curfew is at 8PM. To make matters worse, if I stay out overnight without permission, I'll get interrogated. It's like living in a prison, right?"
<Page7>
"Oh? Hey, that doesn't sound too bad, does it?
That level of supervision should be celebrated, young people need to rein it in a bit. You'll never grow up if you start having fun while you're young."
"I agree, but it's more convincing when you say it."
He is the ultimate bad example after all.
<Page8>
"Is that so? You're being awfully amenable today, Tohno.
Alright, I'll give you a piece of sweet bread then!"
"Like I said, I don't need any food. Don't mind me and just eat. Lunchtime's almost over."
<Page9>
"Really?# Well, I'll be digging in then."
Arihiko clasps his hands together and begins to eat his bread.
Looking at him, he seems like a man who really appreciates his meals.
<Page10>
"Pardon me!"
...And then.
Senpai comes over with what looks like a lunchbox in her hand.
<Page11>
"Oh? Senpai, don't you usually eat in the cafeteria?"
"No, I don't really have a specific place where I always eat. It all depends on how I'm feeling on a given day."
<Page12>
She takes her lunch out of a cute drawstring pouch.
Her lunch looks a little large for that of a girl.
<Page13>
"So I suppose that today, you managed to wake up early and felt like making a packed lunch, right?"
<Page14>
"Yes, I woke up a little before seven this morning, which is unusual for me...
Wait a minute, what are you making me say, Tohno-kun!?"
<Page15>
"No, I wasn't trying to... Senpai, are you perhaps not a morning person?"
"Yes. Actually, I'm pretty bad at waking up early.
When I'm volunteering, I tend to barely scrape by."
<Page16>
"My parents owned a bakery, so I used to wake up very early every day. Unfortunately, no matter how I tried, I always struggled in the morning. My father has been driven mad by it ever since I was a kid."
<Page17>
What? A bakery!?
Arihiko and I look at each other. I bet he's also imagining Ciel-senpai with an oven in her room, kneading and baking flour with her white fingers.
<Page18>
"My battle with my father lasted for about three years, but in the end he said,
'I would rather do the work of two people than train you!'
Then he threw me out of the kitchen.
Ever since, I've been quite self-indulgent about when I choose to wake up."
<Page19>
'Ahem', says Ciel-senpai, looking quite proud of herself.
"Is that so? That's kind of surprising.
You seem like a very capable person."
<Page20>
"Yes, I try my best not to screw up in front of you. To be honest, I'm actually rather clumsy if anything."
<Page21>
...It's certainly possible that she is actually a klutz.
It's the same with her volunteer work.
A capable individual wouldn't go for something like that; there's absolutely nothing for them to gain.
<Page22>
"I see. ―――But I actually like clumsy people.
I feel at ease when I'm with them."
Arihiko nods in agreement.
"So, does a late riser like you normally go to the cafeteria?"
<Page23>
"Yes, I'm in the cafeteria most of the time. I only make my own lunch like this every so often. Usually, it's just a bunch of pre-prepared dishes.
You two prefer eating in the cafeteria, don't you?"
<Page24>
"No, it depends on the mood we're in as well. When I was a freshman, I used to have my sister make lunch, but Tohno always ate bread or cafeteria food, so I'd just eat wherever he's at."
<Page25>
"Huh, Tohno-kun is a moody guy, isn't he?"
"Yeah, you'll only get worn out if you go out with guys like him, so watch out, Senpai."
<Page26>
Senpai agrees with Arihiko and opens the lid of her lunchbox.
The contents of the round lunchbox are subdivided into a section for rice and a section for side dishes. It's a very orthodox lunchbox, but there seems to be a large amount of food.
<Page27>
"Then, let's eat.
Can I borrow your neighbor's chair?"
"The chair of a person who's not here is everyone's chair.
I'm sure Takada-kun would love to have you sit in his seat."
<Page28>
Senpai puts her lunchbox on her lap instead of on my desk and begins to eat.
Standing diagonally across from her is Arihiko, who is unwrapping his second piece of bread.
As I watch the two of them out of the corner of my eye, I gaze idly at the scenery out the window.
<Page29>
"Huh? Tohno-kun, aren't you going to eat?"
"No, I don't feel like it today."
<Page30>
"You're not eating... You're going to get hungry, you know."
"It's fine. I'm more concerned with my health than my appetite. Besides, I'm not so weak that I can't handle skipping lunch."
<Page31>
"Wow, that's amazing. I can't move if I skip even one meal. If I do, I get so starved that I collapse.
...It's embarrassing because I eat a lot more than most people, but I still get hungry easily."
<Page32>
"That's not true. You're a lot more developed than the other girls.# It's natural that the bigger you are, the less fuel-efficient you are." // 摂理 is the actual word but I guess fuel efficient makes more sense
<Page33>
I'm not sure what I feel about Arihiko's statement, but he handled the situation well.
Since she is still growing, I want her to continue to eat and reach her full potential.
I can't tell if Senpai is ashamed or embarrassed by Arihiko's words.
<Page34>
"But Tohno-kun, are you sure you don't mind skipping lunch?"
"It's fine, it's fine. It's not unusual for me to skip meals for an entire day. I've eaten breakfast today, so I'm good to go until the evening."
<Page35>
"Mmm. I don't think that's a good idea.
You'll ruin your body if you live like that."
<Page36>
"Don't worry, there are people who check up on me.
My doctor has warned me not to put on any weight, so it's better for me if I skip a meal every now and then.
I would like to get stronger, but keeping my weight down is the priority."
<Page37>
"I-I see.
Even boys think about dieting, don't they?"
<Page38>
Senpai looks at me with upturned eyes and closes the lid of her lunchbox after some thought.
<Page39>
"Well, I just remembered an errand I have to run, so if you'll excuse me.
Don't worry about me; in fact, I'd rather you forgot about today's conversation."
<Page40>
After quickly cleaning up, Senpai rushes out of the room like the wind.
<Page41>
"―――Mm, cute."
Arihiko nods his head in satisfaction, clearly impressed by what he has seen.
