When I enter the classroom, I find that homeroom is about to start.
I wasn't used to the route, so I must have paced myself wrong.
The morning chatting period is coming to an end, and most of the students have gone back to their desks.
<Page2>
In that situation,
"...Hah, you've arrived with a lot of time to spare, huh?"
Arihiko is standing there with a dejected look on his face, about to take in his seat. ...He seems to be taking class seriously today.
<Page3>
"Good morning, you don't look very well...#Is it because you're in class? What is it? Are you sick or something?"
<Page4>
"I was full of energy until a while ago. After all, Senpai came to visit me."
"By Senpai, you mean Ciel-senpai?"
<Page5>
"Yeah. But since someone else wasn't here, she went back to her classroom because she wasn't in the mood anymore. Why are you always so late in the morning, Tohno?"
<Page6>
So that's what happened... If I knew that Senpai was waiting, I'd have come here running.
<Page7>
"Sorry about that. But there's always the possibility we can meet up with her at lunch. It's not like this was our last chance to see her."
"Of course not. If this was our last chance,
I'd be too shocked to be sitting in class."
<Page8>
"Is that so?", I reply, waving my hand as I head for my desk.
As soon as I sit down, the bell rings and Noel-sensei enters the classroom.
<Page9>
"Hiii, Guud Mornin!"
I'm glad to see everyone's in good shape...wait, #Oh no, there are two absentees. It's the change of season after all,
did they get careless and catch a cold, maybe?"
<Page10>
Noel-sensei starts taking attendance.
One male student and one female student are absent.
I try to remember who those two empty seats belong to,
when, by chance, my eyes meet hers.
<Page11>
"---Ah."
I look away in panic.
...I wonder. I'm sure it's just my imagination, but I think Noel-sensei is looking at me most of the time...
