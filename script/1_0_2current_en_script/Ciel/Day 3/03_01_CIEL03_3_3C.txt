Hearing the sound of rain.
<Page2>
 ...... In the end, I couldn't shake off senpai's kindness.
I took a bath and even had a nightgown prepared for me.
She even got dinner, which was just a convenience store's bentō but... it was good. And because it was raining outside, I borrowed her bed, and now I'm about to fall asleep.
<Page3>
Senpai slept on a futon on the floor next to the bed.
I was adamantly opposed to using her bed but..,
<Page4>
"This is a cheap room, so the floor gets cold. I wouldn't want somewhone who's starting to catch a cold sleeping there. Please use my bed. It's a little better."
"No, um, but the bed is yours senpai ......?"
<Page5>
"Yes, it is. Oh, don't worry about it. I haven't used it much, so it's as good as new. #Japanese beds are nice, aren't they? It's soft and comfortable."
"............"
<Page6>
After saying that, she hushes me onto the bed with a smile.
<Page7>
"―――――――"
 I stared up at the ceiling.
 It's an ordinary structure that can't be compared to the Tohno residence, yet it feels so spacious.
 I'm sure my senses are paralyzed. Senpai's concern is so great that it makes me feel small.
<Page8>
Senpai was cheerful at dinner and talked to me as usual.
She talked about school, various restaurants I didn't know about, and never stopped talking.
<Page9>
I couldn't give her a single satisfactory reply, but I felt sorry and happy at the same time that my head was gradually returning to normal.
<Page10>
 ...... Really, what a mess.
 I killed a person just a few hours ago, and now I'm upset about something like this like a normal student.
 Even though I thought I'd never be able to spend time like this again.
<Page11>
".................."
 I can't sleep, and my gaze sways.
 I'm not sure what I should do.
 Pit-pat.
 The sound of rain can be heard outside.
<Page12>
"Tohno-kun. If you don't go to sleep soon, you'll be late tomorrow."
"...... Senpai, are you awake ......?"
<Page13>
"Yes. I can't sleep until you are asleep. I'm a girl after all."
"...... Sorry. I'll sleep in the kitchen after all.
<Page14>
"Damn it, don't make me say it again. You are in the early stages of a cold and I can't let you sleep in the kitchen. Just forget about it and go to sleep."
<Page15>
"――――― I... can't."
 ...... Ahh, I can't do that.
 It's not something I can forget, it's not something I should ever forget.
<Page16>
 If you've killed someone, for whatever reason.
 It's too sinful to forget what you've taken from them.
<Page17>
"...... No. I can't cover up my sins. I can't forget and I'm not going to forget.
 ...... But thank you. You saved my life today. If you hadn't done that, I really might have died."
<Page18>
 ...... That's the worst kind of escape.
 When I calmed down, even I finally realized that.
 Taking your own life is no atonement for what you've done.
 If you really think you've made a mistake, you shouldn't just run away...
<Page19>
"Sin? It seems that your mistake is something I can't even imagine."
<Page20>
"But Tohno-kun. I don't think there's anyone in this society who doesn't sin. We are all sinners."
"...... Senpai. Are are trying to say...?"
<Page21>
"No, I went too far. Not everyone is a sinner.
 But it's not that there are good people and bad people. It's just that some people inexplicably go astray for some reason.
 We all make mistakes in life. It's sad, but it's inevitable.
 We are animals that live that way. As long as we have wisdom, we can't help but trample on the happiness of others.
<Page22>
 The voice that echoed in the darkness was a little harsh.
 ...... That's surprising.
 I never thought Senpai would hold the view that humanity is fundamentally evil.
<Page23>
"...... What you're saying Senpai, it's like we're beyond redemption. I don't like the metaphor that everyone is making mistakes."
<Page24>
"...... Well then, maybe we are beyond redemption?
 But sins can be atoned for, can't they?
 There are no good people or bad people in the world. There are only those who atone for their sins and those who don't.
 Therefore, I believe that people who can't be saved are those who cannot atone for their own sins no matter what.
<Page25>
"No matter what, you can't atone―――"
"Yes. But Tohno-kun is someone who can atone. I don't know what you've done, but you can make amends, Tohno-kun.
 If you can't sleep because of anxiety, you should think about how you can atone for what you've done.
 It's a very difficult thing to do, so your mind will eventually go blank and you'll be able to sleep easily."
<Page26>
"...... But, Senpai, my sin can never be atoned for. That much, at least, is clear to me."
<Page27>
"Haha, that's right. No matter what it is, a sin can never be completely atoned for.
 Even if you hurt someone and heal their wounds, the sin of hurting them will never go away, right?
 No matter how hard you try, you can't erase the mistakes you've made."
<Page28>
"I was taught that 'atonement' is not a result, but a way of being that is created in the process.
 A mind that can punish itself without being forced to do so by others.
 That's what I mean by people who can make amends and people who can't.
 That's why you are definitely a person who can atone."
<Page29>
 ...... I wonder if that's true.
 But I can't trust myself.
 ...... If this person says so, I want to live my life as if it were so.
<Page30>
"...... I don't know. I'm a terrible person. I'm not as nice as you think I am."
"That's easy to understand. Just now, I was a little moved. Tohno-kun, don't you have a huge scar on your chest?"
"Yes, but ...... what about it?"
<Page31>
"With such a scar, it must have been a very serious accident. A scar can distort the mind.
 It's a little unusual to have a scar that big and that still hasn't gone away."
<Page32>
"But it's very natural to you. If you've lived with that scar, it's definitely something to be proud of.//As in having, living with the scar is natural, nothing usual for him
 You must have had a very straightforward childhood.
 You may be angry, but you will never hold a grudge against <other>people</>."
<Page33>
 After muttering in satisfaction, Senpai stops talking.
<Page34>
 If I listen closely, I can hear her gently breathing in her sleep.
"...... Are you asleep, Senpai?"
 There was no reply.
 The only sound coming from outside is the unceasing rain.
<Page35>
"......... Atonement, huh?"
 A punishment equivalent to the crime committed.
 Tomorrow, her body will be found and reported as a new bizarre murder.
<Page36>
 When that happens, I'll have countless things to lose.
 I'll cause trouble for Akiha, and I won't be able to talk to Senpai like this ever again.
<Page37>
"....................."
 But if that's what it takes to make amends, then I'll have to accept it.
 My life will end there, and the reckoning will begin.
 If it can ease the feelings of the people who knew her... then maybe somehow I'll really be able to atone.
<Page38>
"Ha―――― ah"
 I'm getting a little sleepy.
 I don't know what tomorrow holds.
 I don't know, but if it's allowed.
 I hope that tommorow I will have enough time to thank the people who have helped me, at least.
