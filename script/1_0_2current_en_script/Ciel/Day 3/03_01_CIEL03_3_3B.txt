"I'm home, Tohno-kun. Thank you for taking care of the house for me."
<Page2>
Senpai is holding a number of plastic bags in her hands. She seems to have bought a lot of things.
<Page3>
"Let's see, please change into these for now.
They are cheap, but it's much better than wet clothes. The bath will be ready soon, so if you take it and relax, you'll feel a little better."
<Page4>
"............"
Senpai gets everything quickly and efficiently.
She took care of the bath and my change of clothes.
She...
There's no need for her to do that for me.
<Page5>
"...... It's okay, senpai.
I'm leaving. I can't cause you any more trouble."
<Page6>
I unbutton my shirt, grab my jacket and start walking.
...... Anyway, I can't stay in this room.
<Page7>
"What? No, you can't go out with a pale face like that! At least warm up properly first..."
<Page8>
Senpai's hand reaches out.
As if trying to stop me as I pass by.
I tried to shake it off,
<Page9>
Through a coincidence without any malice, the way of the world has changed completely.
<Page10>
"――――――, ah
 The world is off. It's off. It's off. It's off .
 The world is disconnected. Death comes within seconds.
 A world where everything dies so easily.
 A world as seen by a murderer who kills for no reason.
 There,
<Page11>
"Aww, glasses glasses ......! I'm sorry, that was careless of me! If it's broken, I'll pay for it!"
 The well-intentioned girl who rushed to pick up the glasses... died.//A bit of a creative interpretation to maintain the shock factor
<Page12>
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!"
I swallow up the scream that almost spilled out of my mouth.
I frantically hold back a hand that rose to crush my eyeballs.
<Page13>
 No, it's not. This is just reality as it appears to be.
 It can't be happening. It can't be happening again.
 Yeah, but the blood, the red lines, they're all over the place.
 Just like that woman in white.
 Just like that time.
 Even this person who cared for me is crisscrossed with those red lines of death.
<Page14>
"Tohno-kun ......!?"
<Page15>
 In that case, it's going to happen again. I'm sure it will happen again.
 It doesn't matter if I'm rational or not.
 It doesn't matter if I'm sane or insane.
 I just want to feel good.
 This is the kind of creature I am.
 This is the kind of ■■■■■■■■■■ creature I am.
 Anywhere I find myself into becomes hell.
 So somewhere in my heart, I knew that it was natural for me to screw things up for no reason at all.
<Page16>
 ―――No, that's not it.
 I can't hear senpai's voice.
 But I can see the warmth in her eyes.
<Page17>
 ...... Even if everything I see is hell, the reality is here regardless of that.
 I believe, deep down, that it must continue to exist.
<Page18>
 So that this person can continue to care for me.
 So that I can still recognize it properly.
 The world will continue to live on unchanged and independent of me.
<Page19>
 My heart that felt ready to burst slows down. 
 I pick up my glasses from the floor and slowly put them back on.
<Page20>
"―――Huh. Aaah..."
 I sob and repress my emotions.
 I fall to the floor and exhale heavily. //Lit. falling on his backside
<Page21>
Ahhh...
Senpai saw me in a disgraceful state again, but my thoughts and vision are very much normal now.
<Page22>
"Good. Have you calmed down, Tohno-kun?"
 I look up and see Senpai standing there, the way she always does.
<Page23>
"There, you still can't walk properly right?
 Your body turned extremely cold, do you understand that?"
<Page24>
Senpai sends me a playful smile, as if to say "Regret that!" and holds out her hand to me.
Even after witnessing my breakdown, she's acting like she didn't see anything.
<Page25>
"...... I'm sorry. But that's not a physical problem."
<Page26>
"No, it's a physical problem! You have to understand that you can't stand up by yourself. Look, you're clearly exhausted. #Looking at you right now, even I could probably carry you alone."
 Saying that, Senpai pulls my hand.
<Page27>
"Oh, and ......!"
 I was forcibly taken back to the middle of the room.
 ...... I didn't think I'd actually be carried away.
<Page28>
"Tohno-kun, you can't go back home today right?
 I've already made preparations for tonight, so please be prepared."
"Prepared...Senpai?"
<Page29>
"Please don't leave until you've properly warmed up, eaten dinner, and gotten yourself together. If you leave with a face like that, I won't be able to sleep because I'm worried about you."
<Page30>
"――――――――"
 A different kind of heartache.
 Senpai's concern seems to break my heart, so I turned my head and exhaled.
<Page31>
On one hand, I'm so happy that I'm about to cry, but on the other hand, I'm scared of this person's kindness.
<Page32>
"...... Why?"
"Yes? What is it, Tohno-kun?"
"...... Why are you going that far, Senpai?
 For me..."
 ―――Even though I've killed a person.
<Page33>
"...... I'm no good.
 I just made a terrible mistake and ran away without taking any responsibility, I even thought that I could just die..."
<Page34>
 I'm trying to rely on Senpai.
 That sin.
 Denying the existence of the life I took with my own hands.
<Page35>
"......No matter what I do, my mistakes will not be forgiven. ...... No, I don't think they should ever be forgiven.
 So it's no good. I don't deserve to be treated kindly like this."
<Page36>
"...... Haa. Tohno-kun, you're trying to make yourself out to be a bad person. It seems you've been waiting to be judged like that for a long time."
"What ......?"
<Page37>
"But if you think about it that way, it means you're not sure of your own actions yet, Tohno-kun.//Yet in bold or italics
 You always think it's your fault. Today was a prime example. But you can't figure out if it was really a good thing or a bad thing.
 That's why you have to push yourself one way or another to make it clear.
<Page38>
"―――No, that's..."
<Page39>
  ...... I couldn't say no.
 I admit what I've done.
 But I can't get rid of my strong doubt. Why, why did I do that? I'm still trying to figure out if there was really a problem with me.
<Page40>
  ...... No. I know that I will never be able to understand how I felt at that time.
<Page41>
"But I don't know about the mistake you made.
 To be frank, I don't care about that."
<Page42>
"You say that you don't deserve to be treated kindly, but that's for your own reasons.
 I'm not being nice to you for your sake, so please don't worry too much about it."
<Page43>
"It's not for me. ......?"
<Page44>
"Yes. #......#You see... I'm doing this because I want to be nice to you. In short, it's my hobby. Your situation doesn't really matter.
 Even if you're a bad person, I'll reach out to you. Well, that's not going to happen in a million years."
<Page45>
"What do you mean by 'hobby', ...... Senpai, is helping people a hobby?"
 She was so assertive that I couldn't help but let out a slight laugh.
 Senpai was not offended, on the contrary, she was proud as if she understood what I meant.
<Page46>
"Yes. This time I'm not helping people, I'm just a person who enjoys forcing a boy who wants to be alone to stay with me.
 I'm sure it's annoying for you, but please think of it as being caught by a bad senpai and give up."
<Page47>
 Senpai laughed as she said that.
 It was a soft, considerate smile.
<Page48>
"..............."
 That broke my heart completely.
 She said she would help Tohno Shiki, whom even I couldn't trust.
 She said that even if I was a bad person, she would help me because she wanted to.
<Page49>
 ...... No matter how unforgivable my sin is.
 I was saved by her words.
<Page50>
"...... I see. Thank you, Senpai."
 I let out a deep breath, gratefully, not because she believes in Tohno Shiki, but because a person like Senpai was here for me. 
<Page51>
"No, no, no need to thank me. It's because I'm your senpai."//senpai not capitalised here
 I bow my head, deeply admirative of her proud smile
 I find myself feeling the warmth of my own heartbeat, which I have been so reluctant to hear.
<Page52>
 ...... I really can't look up.
 As long as I am in front of this person, I can no longer think of myself as evil...
