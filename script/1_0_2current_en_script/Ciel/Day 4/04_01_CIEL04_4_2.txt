...No matter how much she looks at me with those eyes, I can't agree.
There is no way I could deal with the absurdity of a woman who could come back to life after being torn apart, or a black panther, or burning corpses.
<Page2>
"...Sorry, but I can't help you. I'm just a student. I don't know what you're expecting, but if you're looking for a partner, look elsewhere."
"Hmm. Do students normally cut up women they don't even know?"
<Page3>
She's got me there. On a scale of normal to abnormal, my eyes are in the same category as her.
...But even my eyes aren't at this level.
I was living a normal life, never veering off the straight and narrow.
If only I hadn't met this unbelievable woman.
<Page4>
"No, you're wrong. I was a normal guy until I met you. I didn't want to kill anyone, and I was doing just fine.
...That's right. That time was just an exception. I'm a bit of a deadbeat, yes, but if I hadn't met you―――"
<Page5>
"Aahh enough, shut up!"
<Page6>
"―――!?"
The pupils of her red eyes widen.
The woman's mood changes completely.
What a terrible chill.
Her glare alone was enough to make me feel like my heart would stop.
<Page7>
"Don't get me wrong. You killed me.
By all rights, I ought to pull your head off right here, but since you seem like you might prove useful I'll spare you for now."
<Page8>
"―――――, Ah."
This is no exaggeration.
With just a stare, the world is transformed into a silent wasteland.
<Page9>
My burning throat and my trembling fingers freeze in an instant.
I am overcome by the <chill|f e a r  > that runs down my spine.//Spacing in ruby is intentional
My instincts as a living creature are warning me.
<Page10>
How did I get such a mistaken impression, I wonder.
The thing I'm looking at is just a killing machine in the shape of a person.
<Page11>
I can't breathe properly.
No, unnecessary movements such as breathing are not allowed.
Breathing in. Turning my eyes. Moving my fingers. It doesn't matter. Whatever it is, if I move even slightly, then in the next instant my body would be pulverized by something enormous.
It is not an illusion, but an inevitable future that my instincts have sensed.
<Page12>
"―――,――――――"
My limbs quiver, desperate to flee this instant.
                             ―――I don't want to die.
I do my utmost to keep my thoughts in order.
                             ―――I don't want to die.
<Page13>
I'm gonna die soon. If I run, I die.
If I stay here, I die. If I move, I die.
But sooner or later, fear will kill my reason.
But if I make a sound, my limbs will be done for.
        ―――That's it. I'll be killed no matter what.
<Page14>
That conclusion burns in my mind.
I'm trapped between two contradictory escapes.
<Page15>
I feel chills as my mind is whittled down and endlessly folded in on itself.
It seemed as though it would go on forever, but suddenly I was released.
<Page16>
"Ah―――, ahhh."
I fall to my knees on the ground.
Released from the pressure, I hug myself.
<Page17>
...Thank goodness. I'm still alive.
<Page18>
"How about it? I hope you understand your position a little better now that I've made it clear to you."
<Page19>
...As if I could understand a thing like that.
I can do nothing but look up at this monster, desperately trying to keep my teeth from chattering.
<Page20>
"It's not a matter of whether you can or can't. If you do as I say, I'll let you live. If you don't, I'll kill you.
See, it's simple, isn't it? I'm only asking you if you want to live or die."
<Page21>
"――――――"
I can't speak properly.
But instinctively, I nod my head.
<Page22>
"Alright. With this, we have a deal then."
The woman holds out her hand to me as I kneel on the ground.
<Page23>
"I'm Arcueid―――well, it's a bit of a long name, so you can just call me Arcueid.
I'm from the True Ancestor caste of vampires, what sort of human are you?"
<Page24>
I sigh heavily after being subjected to a self-introduction unlike any I had ever heard before.
...It's either a sigh of exhausted resignation, or perhaps acceptance of this unbelievable situation.
<Page25>
"I'm Tohno Shiki. Unfortunately, I'm just a student. ...I already mentioned this earlier, but I really am of no use to you."
<Page26>
I hold that woma―――Arcueid's hand and stand up.
She looks at me carefully, and then,
asks me to shake hands with her.
<Page27>
"I look forward to working with you, Shiki.
I'll be sure to have you take full responsibility for killing me back then."
<Page28>
Arcueid smiles and holds out her left hand.
...I'm sure there are many responsibilities in the world, but I'm probably the first and last person to take responsibility by helping the person I killed.
<Page29>
"...Yeah, this really is insane."
But there's nothing I can do about it.
I reluctantly hold out my left hand and shake hands with the woman in white who calls herself a vampire.
