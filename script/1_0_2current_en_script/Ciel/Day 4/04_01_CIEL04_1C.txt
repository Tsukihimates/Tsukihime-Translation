No matter how complicated my feelings are, the morning remains the same.//Some parts of this file is identical to 04_00_ARC04_3
As I approach the school, I start to see students in their school uniforms.
<Page2>
Suddenly, my footsteps almost come to an halt, but I press on to hide my weakness.//強がりで can probably be better worded
After leaving behind the station, this is the scenery I see on my way to school
I walk along the school route that I've gotten familiar with in the past two years.
<Page3>
After I cross this intersection, it's only a little ways to the main gate.
The traffic light turns red, and I stop in front of the crosswalk.
Beyond the crosswalk is the wall of the school.
The path to the school is protected by a guardrail, and even now students are jostling their way towards the school gate.//Jostling as substitute for compound 我先に + 向かう
<Page4>
At this time of the day, the only people on the sidewalk are students from our school.
That is how it should have been.
But in between the restless cars driving by, I sense a white figure.
<Page5>
"―――――Wha"
Over there was a woman.
An unmistakable, white figure.
Golden hair that reminds me of sunlight.
Long, thin eyebrows and red eyes.
I've only seen her once, but there's no way I could mistake her for anyone else.
<Page6>
"―――――――――"
But, that shouldn't be possible.
After all, yesterday she was scattered to pieces by my hands. Shattered. She was reduced to numerous pieces of flesh.
And yet.
And yet, why is /the woman that should have been killed/, still alive and so beautiful?
<Page7>
"....... That, ah"//While playing the game, there's a big section here where the game will switch to Arc route files, from 04_00_ARC04_3 page16 to page107.
I slightly hesitate to say the rest.
<Page8>
Is that really okay?
I've admitted to my crime, but I haven't clearly said what my sin was.
Because I sensed deep down that if I said it, I wouldn't be able to return to my previous life anymore.
But―――――
<Page9>
"Well?"
"―――――――――, ―――――"
<Page10>
My tongue tingles from dryness.
My throat goes numb, don't say it!
<Page11>
...But I can't run away.
This is something I must not run away from.
There was someone who believed in me that taught me this.
<Page12>
That is if I wish to live a normal life.
From the sins that I've committed,
from the actions that I took,
I must never turn my eyes away―――
<Page13>
"...Yeah, I regret it.
After all, I've killed someone no matter how I put it."
I confess like I'm being squeezed.
The same way I confessed yesterday in Senpai's room.
<Page14>
I killed her.
Mercilessly, for no reason at all.
Just for myself, I killed this woman. I admit it.
<Page15>
"...I can regret and reflect on that.
...That is if you allow me."
If I'm allowed to take such an easy way out.
<Page16>
"...I will bow as many times as you want.
...But doing that would be meaningless.
It doesn't change the fact that I killed you with my own hands. That's why―――"
<Page17>
There's no way I can be forgiven.
It's not acceptable to say "It doesn't matter because she's alive again".
I, Tohno Shiki, have killed this girl in front of me.
It is the final thing that can be taken.
A level of violence that cannot be surpassed.
<Page18>
"That's why―――you can have your revenge on me.
...I didn't run away because I was afraid of you. I was only running away from myself."
<Page19>
I keep my head down.
I mutter these words to myself without repenting to anyone.
<Page20>
...Then, I finally wake up.
It's like I was in a dream since yesterday.
A transient dream before the end.
An escape from a reality where I kept running from my own cowardice.
And now, at last, the retribution...
