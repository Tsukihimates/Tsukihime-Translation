As it turns out, the situation at the mansion is the same as yesterday morning.
<Page2>
"Welcome back, Shiki-san.
Last night was terrible with all that rain."
<Page3>
As soon as I entered the lobby, I was greeted with a smile.
<Page4>
"I uh, I'm back... Uhh, Kohaku-san"
"Uh huh, are you asking about breakfast?
It will be ready in just a minute, so please have a seat in the living room. Akiha-sama just finished her work too."
<Page5>
Kohaku heads briskly for the west wing on the first floor, where the kitchen is located. 
<Page6>
The sun shines through the skylight, and I could hear the faint tweet of songbirds.
... It's too peaceful.
There isn't any signs yesterday's murder has been reported, and even fewer trace of the police.//警察の手
<Page7>
"........."
For now, I decide to go back to my room and change my clothes.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama. I am pleased to welcome you back."
"Ah, yes. I just came back."
<Page9>
Hisui was in my room.
She was standing near the window, so I guess she was airing the room, as she does every morning.
<Page10>
"I'm sorry Hisui but do you have a spare jacket? The one I'm wearing got wet in the rain yesterday."
"Of course. I'll bring one right away."
Hisui bowed and went to get a change of clothes for me.
<Page11>
Akiha is sitting on the sofa in the living room with an angry look on her face.
<Page12>
"... Ara, good morning Nii-san
I didn't know you were back."
There was a hint of reproach in her voice.
<Page13>
"G-good morning Akiha... You uh don't look very pleased this morning."
"Quite. I didn't know that my brother was the type of person to often spend the night outside. I feel more astounded than unpleased."
<Page14>
Let me rephrase. It wasn't "a hint", she was now frontally condemning her brother.//Shiki reuses the "どことなく" from Page 12, let's try to keep the reference if possible
<Page15>
"Well, it can't be helped if you're not feeling well
This Inui fellow has been a friend of yours since middle school, hasn't he?"
<Page16>
Ooh, I never though I'd hear that name coming from Akiha's mouth.
It looks like Arihiko really did call.
I'm still a little uneasy though.
What did that orange guy say during the phone call?
<Page17>
"Goodness. What were you thinking, walking around without an umbrella?
And on top of that, saving a kitten from being carried away by a river, helping a child crying in a cake shop, solving a theft case concerning a coffee shop? What is this, a mystery novel?
Well, it was a good story. Helping the kitten rather than ignoring it, that's quite like you Nii-san."
<Page18>
"Ah... Well, hahaha."
That's a mish-mash of stories that seem familiar to me. That's really suspicious. However putting aside its authenticity , Akiha appears to believe the whole story. //しかし信憑性はあったのか
... And that's to be expected because it's an amalgation of various things that happened around here recently. That's why the details were probably realistic. 
<Page19>
"In the first place, #if you have to leave school early, please let us know. We would have immediately sent a car to pick you up.
I do not know why you refrain so much, but I have told before that you are the eldest son of the Tohno family. Please use whatever is at your disposal. As it is, your body is already more fragile than most people, Nii-san"
<Page20>
"Yesterday it suddenly rained, so there must have been a change in air pressure, but I can't believe that you would get anemia from that.//Needs double check to be sure
Even if this time you get checked by the familiy doctor, wouldn't it be better for you to go to school by car?"
<Page21>
"Don't worry, Akiha, it's nothing to be concerned about. Besides, I go to the hospital once a week. It's going to school every day be car that will weaken my body.
I'm glad you're worried about me, but don't be so fussy about me."
<Page22>
"... I see. If you say so, then I will not force you. But to correct you Nii-san, my concerns are not about you body, but about the health of the eldest son of the Tohno family."
<Page23>
Akiha states the facts dispassionately.
I wanted to point out that it was the same thing, but was afraid of the consequences, so I didn't. //Was a quote in Japanese, we could keep it: I wanted to tell her "Isn't that the same thing?"
<Page24>
"Shiki-san, breakfast is ready!"
I could hear Kohaku's cheerful voice from the dining room just across the lobby. 
... Ah. That puts an end, although a bit awkwardly, to my morning conversation with Akiha.//I believe it's the conversation with Akiha that's still awkward but I think switching is okay
<Page25>
"... Sorry. I've got to go soon. I'll quickly get some grub."
<Page26>
"Nii-san, please don't use such crude language
If you do not sufficiently endeavor to improve, I will order you as head of the family to do so"//Any changes should keep a formal tone. It's always keigo with Akiha but it's really a mouthful here
<Page27>
She pouts while purses her graceful lips.
Ah, that's the Akiha I remember, saying strict words while making a sulky face that doesn't correspond at all.
<Page28>
"... Good. You're back to your usual self. I'm definitely troubled when you're not like that. Don't worry about me, just take it easy from now on.
<Page29>
"-----You're so persistent!
I'm not worried about you Nii-san!"
<Page30>
Akiha turns her away like she's displeased.
A smile comes to my face was I watching her. I don't want to part with her but heads to the dining room.
<Page31>
Hisui see me off before I set off.
"........."
Hisui hands me my bag, then hesistates slightly before opening her mouth.
<Page32>
"... I know this is not my place, but forgive me for asking. What did you do last night?"
"Nothing in particular. I just got anemic from the rain. I'll be careful from now on."
<Page33>
"I am criticing you Shiki-sama. It's just that you seem extremely exhausted this morning.
... Please, take care on your way."
<Page34>
Hisui deeply bows and sends me off. 
... I tried to act as calm as possible, but even though Akiha and Kohaku didn't see through me, it doesn't look like it's working with Hisui. 
<Page35>
"... Are you worried about me Hisui?"
It's hard to tell what she's feeling with how detached she seems, but it's clear that she cares for me.
I thank her while waving my head and walk away from the house.
<Page36>
Today is the last time I will see this sight.
It's barely been two days since I've returned home, so I can't be regretful.//Someone double check this
If I can be granted a little more time, I'd like to tie off loose ends---go to school and greet the people who have taken care of me. 
<Page37>
If I could say goodbye as usual and have a day with no regrets, that would a far better conclusion than I deserve.
