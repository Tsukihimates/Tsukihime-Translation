...I'm still not prepared to return to the Tohno house.
I don't have anything in particular to do, but maybe I should wander around the school to calm down...?
<Page2>
Suddenly, I remember that I had made a promise this morning to meet someone.
"...That's right.
I told her on the train that I was going to stop by the tea ceremony club."
<Page3>
It must be fate that I remembered it like this.
There's still time, so I'll go to the tea ceremony room.
<Page4>
The tea ceremony clubroom is located at the end of the club activity building.
About ten minutes have passed. The reason why it took me so long to find the clubroom is that no one knew where it was.
In the end, I went to the staff room and found where it was on the floor plan.
<Page5>
"Excuse me. Senpai, are you there?"
I knock on the sliding door and call out to her.//横開きの扉をノックして、呼びかける。
Soon after, //Matches JP text and flows better
<Page6>
"Oh. Look who's here, it's Tohno-kun."
The familiar face of Ciel-senpai appears.
<Page7>
"Have you come to visit me, by any chance? No, that must be the reason!
Well, if that's the case, come on inside! I wanted to talk to you too."
"...Y-Yeah. Well then, pardon my intrusion."
<Page8>
Although I'm a little embarrassed by her forcefulness, I did come here to talk to her.
I enter the tea ceremony room obediently.
<Page9>
The clubroom looks more authentic than I had expected.
It's a completely Japanese-style room.
"...I'm surprised. I didn't know that our school had such a classroom. Isn't this a hobby room or something?"
<Page10>
"I think so too. Officially, it was supposed to be for club activities, but I guess it was the principal's hobby.
However, it seems that this room wasn't being used until I joined."
<Page11>
Senpai goes ahead of me to the tatami mat and begins preparing tea.
"It wasn't being used until you joined...?"
<Page12>
"That's right. It's a shame that the tea ceremony club had become an imaginary club with no members!
Sweets are a stabilizer for the mind. To think that a way of conveying the excellence of Japanese sweets had fallen into disuse, it's like taking smiles away from a city. No, it's more like abandoning a puppy on a rainy day!"
<Page13>
"So, I asked the teachers to let me restart the tea ceremony club. I'm still the only member, so it's just temporarily operational until we have five members."
"I-I see. You really like sweets, huh."
But I don't think that's the point of the tea ceremony.
<Page14>
"Yes. Western ones are my favorite, but I won't discriminate amongst carefully made sweets."
<Page15>
"Anyway, as the leader of the tea ceremony club, I've been steadily recruiting people. Thanks to that, I'm allowed to use the clubroom freely like this after school and during breaks.
If there's anything you need, please let me know. I'm usually here after school."
"I-Is that so?"
<Page16>
Is this mixing personal and public affairs or more like a secret base, I wonder?
It would be an honor to be invited by Ciel-senpai to join the tea ceremony club, but will that be enough to revive it?
<Page17>
"But you're a curious person too. It's true that I invited you, but I didn't expect you to come all the way to the tea ceremony room. Are you a predator in spite of your appearance?"
<Page18>
The back of my neck turns red at her teasing voice.
'I wasn't intending to hit on you. I just wanted to drop by'... is what I was getting ready to say, but I realized it would just be an excuse.
<Page19>
"No... really, there was no particular reason..."
It's no wonder that Ciel-senpai pointed it out.
She only asked me to come if I was interested, which is something I wouldn't normally do.
"...Oh, I'm sorry. I think I put too much pressure on you."
<Page20>
Senpai mutters to herself and then claps her hands together.
"――――――Ugh"
I squint at the red sunlight through the window.
While I'm distracted by the strangeness of the tea ceremony room, Senpai takes a cushion from the closet and places it on the tatami.
<Page21>
"......"
Tea is tea, but this looks like a really serious tea ceremony.
<Page22>
"Excuse me, Senpai. I'm not well versed in this sort of etiquette..."
"That's no problem. I only know about pouring tea. Feel free to make yourself comfortable."
<Page23>
I'm served a teapot, a teacup, and some tea cakes.
The snacks are miniature cakes and rice crackers sold at convenience stores for a certain price per bag, so this seems to be a place just for drinking tea and chatting.
<Page24>
"We're just here to chat, so let's not get too formal. That's no fun.
You don't have to be so stiff, okay? You can relax and sit however you like."//正座とかしないで、足を崩しちゃってもいいですよ？」
<Page25>
She smiles softly and pours tea into teacups for the two of us.
"...Hah. Whether you're being earnest or generous, I don't really understand you well, Senpai."
I pick up the offered teacup and bring it to my mouth.
<Page26>
Although I was never involved, the Arima family was the head of a tea ceremony school. Perhaps because I grew up in such a house, I'm accustomed to spending time drinking tea in a Japanese-style room.
<Page27>
I drink my tea slowly as if consuming time itself.
...And then.
Senpai is looking at me with a troubled expression.
