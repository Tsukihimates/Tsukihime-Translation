<Page1>
...But ...I am curious.
More than the bag on her shoulder, I find my eyes drawn to the pair of legs that have slipped into view.
<Page2>
"------"
The splendid sweep of her legs is the embodiment, or maybe the crystallization, of living energy.
Though still, they manifest the lively motion of smoothly flowing water.
This is what I would call beauty in form. I can't look away. In fact, forget looking away - I'm actively being drawn in.
<Page3>
"Um, ...Tohno-kun?"
<Page4>
Then, I realize that beauty and strength go hand in hand.
Her legs are quite plump, but the truth is, these are the legs of a sprinter.
According to a rumor, she set a new school record in the physical fitness test the other day, beating out the track team. These are the legs of a 13-second 100-meter runner... I feel like I'm looking at a living gem.
<Page5>
"Umm, you know, your face is very close to my....and the movement of your hands...."
"I'm sorry. I am in the middle of a serious conversation."
"Huh? What? Are you serious?"
<Page6>
Unfortunately, I am neither her trainer nor her rival athlete.
And you don't just wake up one day and suddenly get interested in running and speed.
<Page7>
"Ah, no, but you see, I don't know what you're serious about!"
"That's true. I don't understand either."
<Page8>
How can I put into words the psychology of being attracted to something beautiful?
However, the situation where you cannot honestly say that something is beautiful is also wrong, isn't it?
When will human beings be able to transcend all prejudices and discriminations and talk about the essence of things?
<Page9>
"Ouch!?"
"T-Tohno-kun, are you all right!?
You just got hit in the head with something!?"
"...Yes, somehow I'm alright."
<Page10>
While holding back the pain in the side of my head, I pick up the object that fell on the seat.
A metallic, shiny, palm-sized hunk of metal.
It's a smartphone, no matter how you look at it.
<Page11>
"Excuse me. Did something fly over here?"
"...Maybe this. It was flying really fast. Is there an app in it that lets you fly it around?"
<Page12>
"Are you an idiot? Thank you very much."
The girl takes the phone as if nothing had happened and walks away to a door one row of seats away.
<Page13>
"......"
"......"
I was staring at Senpai for too long.
<Page14>
Anyway, I come back to my senses.
I clear my throat to change the atmosphere.
<Page15>
"I'm sorry, I got a little distracted.
More importantly, is something the matter? Senpai, you're not a member of any club. Why go to school at this hour?"
<Page16>
"Well, what do I have to hide? I'm on my way back from volunteer activities.
You see, the student council asked for volunteers to pick up trash in the park, right? That's what I was doing until just now."
<Page17>
When she said that, I go, "Ah" and it all makes sense to me.
Senpai who looks good in glasses is always working hard for someone else.
<Page18>
"It was just an early morning volunteer activity for 30 minutes.
Everyone else had already gone home, but I thought I'd just go back to school since it was too much trouble."
<Page19>
The bag on Senpai's shoulder makes a clanking sound.
I thought it was a tool for club activities, but it seems to be a cleaning tool.
<Page20>
"Oh, do you want to see what's inside? You're so bold to check out your Senpai's belongings, even though you look so gentle."
<Page21>
Senpai leans in closer as if staring into my face.
...Well, her face, her smell, and so many other things are so close that I'm not even sure where to look.
<Page22>
"No, no, it's not that, I just thought that if you have a foldable broom or a rake that would be unusual..."
<Page23>
"Hoh hoh, I see you also want to see my pruning shears. All right. In that case, come by the tea ceremony club after school. You're more than welcome."
<Page24>
I feel embarrassed when she said that with a soothing smile.
Not being able to give a witty reply, all I can say is a weak "yes".
I don't know where the tea ceremony club room is, but I can find that out later.
<Page25>
"It's a promise then. Between you and me, we have a surplus of snacks purchased with club funds. It's not something that stays fresh long, so I need a healthy boy to help out."
<Page26>
"I-is that so? Well, if my schedule permits, I'll certainly take you up on that offer.
Although getting taken in by food is something a cat would do."
<Page27>
Her smile is so friendly that I couldn't help but joke a little.
The green ribbon wearing Senpai spoke,
<Page28>
"It's more like a dog, I think.
I mean, felines are not good. The ones you can rely on to the end are the disciplined and intelligent canines!"
She looks pleased with herself and shows a determination that I couldn't quite understand.
<Page29>
Because our destination is the same, the conversation somehow continues.
We talked about last week's mid-term exams.
About the gymnastics festival, which was reduced in scale and only lasted one day.
About the cafeteria, where the menu has never changed.
About the controversy between the students and the school over the use of mobile devices, we both sighed, so we changed the topic and laughed about our impressions of a movie we had recently seen.
<Page30>
Fifteen minutes pass quickly.
Senpai is a good conversationalist, and rumors have it that she is "well-liked by both men and women".
I regret that we'd get to Souya Station in a few minutes, so I ask her what she wants to talk about next.
---But.
<Page31>
"...Hey, you're making too much noise."
Just like that, we were unaware of our surroundings.
<Page32>
We both bow our heads to apologize.
"......"
<Page33>
"...We've made her angry."
"...Sorry.
I was laughing too loud, I guess."
<Page34>
After that, the conversation ends.
It is as though the friendly atmosphere we had experienced until just now was a lie.
Everyone is just a stranger, and the silence peculiar to a city dominates the train.
<Page35>
The train arrives at Souya Station.
It is just before 7 am.
It is a little early for school, and the city is still asleep.
The station is quiet now, but in an hour, it will be full of people and cars.
<Page36>
"There's not much traffic this morning either. It seems like the city is waking up late these days. I wonder if everyone is staying up late."
Senpai says something strange while carrying her heavy luggage.
<Page37>
"Um...can I take your luggage to school?"
Eh? Ah, no, no, don't worry about it. I have a stop to make, so I'll leave you here."
<Page38>
And so, waving her hands with a smile, Senpai runs off.
It is such a light and fast run that an onomatopoeic sound like "babyun" would be appropriate.
<Page39>
I feel like running along with her, but there is no reason to hurry.
I'm going to head to school at my usual pace because I have to take care of my body.
<Page40>
...And then.
The girl from earlier comes out of the ticket gate.
She walks past me at a fast pace,
<Page41>
"You're too animalistic.
Don't you feel embarrassed to be doing that in a public place?"
and leaves behind a strong comment.
