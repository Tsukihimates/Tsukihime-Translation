Unfortunately, I don't have anything to talk to her about.
She doesn't seem to care that I'm at a loss for words and keeps smiling.

"Um... do you go to school by train, Senpai?"
"Well, yes. I use it when I have to.
What about you, Tohno-kun? Is your house far from here?"
<Page3>
"Yes, it's pretty far, near the station at the start of the line.
But today is the last day for me to go to school by train."
"Oh. Are you moving?"
"......"

I can't think of a good explanation, so I keep my mouth shut.
I gaze out the window and watch the city go by.
Perhaps sensing that I'm not comfortable talking about the situation, Ciel-senpai refrains from questioning me further on that matter.

For 15 minutes, our casual conversation continues.
The train soon arrives at my destination, Souya Station.

It's just before seven o'clock.
It's a little early for school, and the city is still asleep. The station is quiet now, but in an hour, it'll be full of people and cars.

"I'll leave you here then.
Thank you for talking to me. If you see me at school, please don't hesitate to say hello."

Waving her hands with a smile, Senpai runs off.
She's so lively that I feel like running as well, but I'm not in any particular rush.//あまりの軽快さにこちらも走りたくなったが、とくに急ぐ理由はない。

Due to my health condition, I decide to go to school at my normal pace.
