"What's the matter, Senpai? You don't look happy."
"Eh? Ah, well, #I was a little surprised that you seemed to be more relaxed than I am."
<Page2>
"No, my family has always been strict, so I'm just used to this kind of thing.
...More importantly, Senpai, what did you want to talk to me about?"
<Page3>
"Yes. I hadn't thanked you yet for this morning. I caused you a bit of bother on the train, right? I wanted to service you like this by way of an apology."
With a soft smile on her face, Senpai says something outrageous.
<Page4>
"U-um, you're using Japanese wrong, Senpai."
"Oh, really? Well, isn't being polite and hospitable called servicing...?"
<Page5>
"I can't say. I don't think it's wrong, but it's not quite right either."
<Page6>
"...Hmm, is that so? I'm sorry, I unknowingly said something strange. After all, you really shouldn't speak in a manner that doesn't match your heart."
<Page7>
Senpai slumps her shoulders.
...I feel sorry for her when she is so remorseful.
<Page8>
"...Well. Your heart was in the right place. To be honest, it made me happy to hear it.
They say etiquette comes first from the heart, and if one's feelings are genuine, minor mistakes can be laughed off."
I encourage her.
<Page9>
Senpai is staring at me intently.
...Her eyes are so serious that I feel as if I'm a rare animal in a zoo.
<Page10>
"....."
"...Senpai?"
It's partly because I'm not used to it, but it's really embarrassing to be stared at like this.
<Page11>
"---Tohno-kun, you look really good.
You're younger than me, and yet you're so composed and cocky."
<Page12>
Senpai glares at me disapprovingly.
This is the second time that I can't understand her thought process at all.
<Page13>
"I'm sorry. That was kind of an arrogant thing to say, wasn't it?"
"Yes. You were so cocky, I was unintentionally touched. It's kind of embarrassing to have a younger boy do that to you."
<Page14>
Despite her words, Senpai smiles happily.
Surely... she's not angry, right?
<Page15>
"I really want to know more about you.
I'd be happy to talk to you about anything."
"...All right, but...
It would be boring to talk about me, Senpai."
<Page16>
"No problem", Senpai replies with a smile.
...It can't be helped. I'm not sure if I can live up to her expectations, but let's just talk about what happened at school---
<Page17>
...We end up talking for about an hour.
Senpai is happy to listen to whatever I had to say, which was fun, but I am tired because I am not used to talking for so long.
<Page18>
The most popular story is about the school trip, which apparently Senpai couldn't take part in because she had caught a cold the day before and had to take a day off.
<Page19>
"It was during the second year of junior high school, which means you were 14 years old.
I would have liked to have seen you at that age."
Saying that with such a smile, I couldn't help but blush.
<Page20>
We have a lot to talk about, but the sun would set soon.
I excuse myself to Senpai and reluctantly leave the tea ceremony room.
