<Page1>
The corridor is crowded with students passing by during lunch break.
Most of them head for the cafeteria, but some visit their friends' classes with their lunch boxes in hand or head for the courtyard or the gym.
<Page2>
As I mix in with the crowd, I wonder whether I should have a solid lunch in the cafeteria or buy a loaf of bread at the store.
<Page3>
At the end of the corridor, I see the familiar figure of Senpai.
<Page4>
"...?"
Is it my imagination?
Or is she coming straight towards me...?
<Page5>
"Oh good, I've been looking for you, Tohno-kun.
You saved me the trouble of having to visit your classroom."
<Page6>
"W-Well, that's great. Hello, Ciel-senpai."
For some reason, I feel embarrassed and reply with a lackluster greeting.
<Page7>
"Yes, hello.
But we've already met today, so 'hello' is not the right word."
"Ah... yeah. Now that you say that, you're right."
<Page8>
I look away, feeling more and more embarrassed.
...Why is that I wonder.
I'm used to talking to Senpai, but today I'm unusually conscious of her. I wonder if it's because she saw me absorbed in my thoughts this morning.
<Page9>
"...Tohno-kun? You seem somewhat restless, are you in a hurry or something?"
<Page10>
"No, I'm not in a hurry at all."
I can't say that I'm curious about every move she's making.
"Anyway, Senpai, you were looking for me, is there something I can help you with?"
<Page11>
"Yes. I'm sure I caused you some trouble this morning.
I wanted to apologize for that, so I've been looking for you."
<Page12>
"Trouble this morning... Ah, you mean on the train?
But that was more of a blessing than trouble."
It was fun talking with Ciel-senpai.
Thanks to that, I didn't notice how long it took to get to the station.
<Page13>
"But you got yelled at by that girl because of me.
I apologize for that. If you don't mind me asking, are you going to have lunch now?"
"Yes. I was trying to decide if I should go to the cafeteria or just buy something."
<Page14>
"Great, then I can join you. I'll treat you as an apology for this morning, so let's go to the cafeteria now."
"Eh?"
With a smile on her face, Senpai grabs my arm and starts walking.
<Page15>
A third year student standing in the second years' hallway is enough to stand out, but this is even more noticeable.
All the students in the hallway are looking at us.
<Page16>
"W-Wait a minute...!
It was my fault this morning, so there is no need for you to apologize...! In fact, it's the other way around. I should be the one apologizing!"
Realizing that I'm blushing right now, I move a bit away from Senpai.
<Page17>
"Hoh. I can't ignore that. It was you who should have apologized? So in other words, as punishment you will do me a favor, right?"
<Page18>
"――――――"
Her teasing glances make my already red cheeks even redder.
<Page19>
"No, that was just a figure of speech."
"Then give it up and let me take you to the cafeteria.
I'm in the mood to have lunch with someone. Consider it bad luck and let me treat you."
<Page20>
...That's just unfair.
If someone smiles at you like that, you can't say no.
<Page21>
"...Hah. Getting treated you say, but this is quite the opposite, Senpai."
<Page22>
"I mean, I really enjoyed talking to you on the train.
So let's hurry to the cafeteria!
If we don't, there won't be any free seats left!"
<Page23>
Ciel-senpai takes my hand again and walks down the corridor.
<Page24>
We must have beaten the crowds, as there are plenty of open tables in the cafeteria.
Though there is a sizable queue at the counter already, it should take about five minutes to order... or thereabouts.
<Page25>
"I'll go get in line. Tohno-kun, please save a seat for me. Is there any food you don't like? If so, you should tell me now."
<Page26>
"Nope, none, I don't have any likes or dislikes in particular."
"That's a very good answer.
Then, I'll be off in a flash."
<Page27>
Without waiting for my reply, Ciel-senpai gets in line to order.
"........."
I guess I'll have to accept that I'm being treated to lunch today.
<Page28>
"Vacant seats for two... if possible, seats in a corner would be nice..."
I'm not sure if my mind can handle this whole situation of having lunch with Ciel-senpai.
<Page29>
So I'd prefer to sit in a place where we can't be seen by many people.
Looking around the cafeteria, I see that there are empty seats in the middle while the corner seats are already occupied by other students' belongings.
At this hour, there are no corner seats for two people―――
"―――There it is."
<Page30>
"........Hah."
However, the table is about to be occupied by a familiar face.
<Page31>
"Yo, Tohno, c'mere c'mere."
<Page32>
Without a care about the world, an orange-haired delinquent student is waving his hand in the air. It's a real headache.
<Page33>
That said, ignoring him would be rude and there are no other empty corner seats available.
In a way, he is a man who can keep people away. I might as well make good use of this friend of mine for this purpose then.
<Page34>
"You're late. Didn't I tell you there'd be a special guest today? Stop acting so carefree like you're some kind of executive here."
<Page35>
"Ah, I remember you saying something like that.
So, where is this special guest?"
<Page36>
"Mmm, that's the thing. I've been trying to schedule it since yesterday, but she refused this morning saying 'I'm busy at lunch today because there's someone I want to apologize to'."
His shoulders slump in disappointment as he eats his Chikara Udon.
<Page37>
"...Someone she wants to apologize to?"
That sounds all too familiar.
"This special guest, is she a third year by any chance?"
"Ooh!"
<Page38>
"A short-haired girl who looks good with glasses. Cheerful and unable to keep still, but is still dependable?"
"What the hell, since when can you read my thoughts?"
"...No, that's not it, it's just..."
<Page39>
"Sorry for the wait.
Are you sure you want to sit here, Tohno-kun?"
<Page40>
Senpai comes over with a bright smile.
In her hands, she is carrying a tray for two people.
<Page41>
"What the hell!?"
"Hmm? Inui-kun,# what a coincidence."
Senpai takes a seat quite naturally.
She takes the seat opposite me――― which puts her next to Arihiko.
<Page42>
"O―――oo, OOoOO!?"
Arihiko makes an unfamiliar sound. Perhaps he can't cope with the sudden good fortune. I know how he feels because that's what I was experiencing not too long ago.
<Page43>
"Please help yourself, Tohno-kun.
Don't hesitate to fill up on food today."
<Page44>
And there's no way I can say no to a smile like that.
I give up and sit down in the seat facing Ciel-senpai.
<Page45>
"All right then, thank you very much."
I clasp my hands together and look down at the tray that Senpai has brought.
<Page46>
"...?"
On the tray, there was# Curry rice,# Curry rice,# and then Curry udon.
"........."
Wait, what??
<Page47>
"Um, Senpai...?"
"Yes? What is it, Tohno-kun?"
"No, this――― what is the meaning of this?"
<Page48>
"What, you say, I mean it's lunch for you and me. What else could it be?"
"...Yes, but I can only see curry..."
<Page49>
"Of course, it's everyone's favorite, classic curry."
You don't have to tell me that. The problem is that there is only curry.
<Page50>
"...You bought three dishes."
"Of course. You're a boy, so you should eat a lot. I'm fine with just one dish, so please choose whatever you like."
<Page51>
"...Then, I'll have curry rice and curry udon."
Any other combination will just be having the same dish twice.
<Page52>
"Please don't leave any food behind.
You're not a picky eater, right, Tohno-kun?"
"――――――――"
There is not a trace of malice in her smile.
She is not joking or teasing, she has perfectly good intentions without a hint of evil.
<Page53>
"Thanks for the meal."
I give in and dip my spoon into the curry rice.
And then.
"Damn you, Tohno-kun!"
The man who's been quiet for the past few minutes has finally woken up.
<Page54>
"How long are gonna keep giving your dear best friend the cold shoulder!? You should be like 'Hey! Thanks for always being alive, Inui-kun! Oh! By the way, I should totally introduce you to my beautiful senpai today! Oh no! Something came up! Time to go to the back of the school, and then you two can have a pleasant chat! And if you have any leftover curry udon, you can give it to me!'"
"No, I won't. But thank you for always being alive, Inui-kun."
<Page55>
Arihiko's arm stretches out to me.
I skillfully guard the curry udon against those evil hands.
<Page56>
"Eh? Inui-kun, you know Tohno-kun?"
"What are you talkin' bout? We've known each other since middle school, we're best buds!"
My so-called close friend reiterates strongly.
<Page57>
"I see. I'm sorry I broke my promise. You see, the person I caused trouble for this morning was Tohno-kun."
<Page58>
"It's okay! It's for a good reason. I would've brought him here myself if you'd told me his name.
So, what bad things did this guy do to you anyway?"
<Page59>
"We bumped into each other on the train early in the morning, and while we were chatting, another passenger got angry.
That's no good. I should have thought about the people around us. It wasn't his fault, but he got yelled at because of me."
<Page60>
"Ah, an early morning train? People are free to talk as they like, but you should...# wait. Early morning? I know Tohno does, but do you come to school by train as well?"
<Page61>
"I was on my way back from volunteering this morning. Picking up trash in the park.
Didn't you see the bulletin board at school? Students were asked to participate voluntarily."
<Page62>
"Ah, that thing at the seaside park... as expected of Senpai, thanks for your hard work.
But the teachers rely on you because you do that. I hope you don't let them get carried away, because they'll slack off whenever they feel like it."
<Page63>
"It's okay, I do it because I like it.# Besides, the teachers are thinking about the school. I don't like the way you're talking about them, Inui-kun."
<Page64>
Ciel-senpai rebukes Arihiko's lazy opinions.
From the looks of it, he seems to be close to her in his own way.
<Page65>
"Senpai, do you do volunteer work every day by any chance?"
"What, you don't know? Ciel-senpai here is such a handy person that she's called the true student council president."
<Page66>
"I know. She's the perfect third year who can solve anything, unlike the student council which is just a title at best."
<Page67>
"Yeah. There's even a fan club made among the first years, and whenever something troublesome happens, even the teachers would say, 'Just talk to Ciel and you'll be fine'. Nowadays, Senpai could do just about anything and the teachers wouldn't complain."
Arihiko says it proudly as if he's talking about himself.
<Page68>
"...I didn't know about the fan club. You're amazing, Ciel-senpai. It's a big deal to be counted on by the teachers, that's for sure."
I look at Senpai with admiration.
<Page69>
"Ah, yeah. Well, thank you very much."
<Page70>
Senpai stirs her curry rice with a spoon.
I suppose it is to hide her embarrassment, but it also reminds me of my immediate enemy.
Curry rice as well as curry udon is on my plate.
<Page71>
Although the doctor has warned me not to eat too much, I would feel sorry for Senpai if I didn't finish eating both.
I guess I'll have the curry rice first before my stomach is full.
<Page72>
Meanwhile, Senpai and Arihiko are talking about each other's current residences.
I knew that Arihiko's parents had passed away, but it seems that Ciel-senpai is living alone as well.
<Page73>
I heard that Senpai's apartment is rather close to Souya Station.
It seems that she's renting an apartment in the residential area to the east of the south gate where the office district is, instead of the north gate where the downtown area is.
<Page74>
"Oh, yeah.
By the way, where do you live, Tohno-kun?"
"Yes?"
As I'm eating curry rice in peace, Senpai suddenly asks me a question.
<Page75>
"If you're asking where, well, it's hard to answer..."
After all, I'm changing my residence today.
I don't feel comfortable explaining the situation. If possible, I'd like to keep it a secret and cover it up.
<Page76>
...I can't even tell a good lie if someone is staring straight at me like this.
<Page77>
"...I'll answer that with a question.
Why do you want to know where I live?"
<Page78>
"Eh? But you asked me where my apartment was, didn't you? I think it's unfair that I'm the only one who doesn't know where you live.# ...Um, is that weird?"
<Page79>
"Well, it's a little weird.
To say it's unfair, that's a strange thing to worry about, isn't it, Senpai?"
<Page80>
"Mm. It's not strange.
If I don't know where you live, I won't be able to visit if something happens to you."
<Page81>
My mouth that is chewing on the curry rice has stopped.
I feel as if someone just said something that made me happy.
<Page82>
"...Visit me? For example, if I catch a cold, will you come to visit me?"
"No, I won't.
At the moment, I have no intention of doing so."
<Page83>
"........"
I guess I was celebrating too early.
Senpai has no such intentions.
I see. In other words, she's just an airhead, isn't she?
<Page84>
"My house is in this city, too. It takes less than 30 minutes to walk.
If you go up to the suburbs from the north gate, you'll see a residential area at the top of a hill. It's at the end of that hill."
<Page85>
"Oh, that's right. You're moving in today, right?"
Arihiko makes a deliberate comment.
Senpai tilts her head slightly.
<Page86>
"Moving in? Are you a transfer student?"
"Huh?"
Senpai says something strange.
I look at Arihiko silently.
<Page87>
"Look here, I've been in this school since the first year, and I've known you since then.
Why did the word 'transfer student' come up in your mind?"
"Because I heard you're moving―――"
<Page88>
"Moving doesn't make anyone a new student. I've just changed my address, not my school.
I've been living with my relatives, but from today onwards, I'm going back to my old home."
<Page89>
After a look of surprised incomprehension from Senpai, she seems to grasp the situation.
<Page90>
"So you just changed your address.
And now you've moved to a residential area in the suburbs."
"That's right. To the ostentatious place at the top of the hill."
<Page91>
"I see, that makes sense. Are you talking about the Tohno mansion?"
<Page92>
Senpai asks hesitantly.
To the people from the city, the western-style building on the hill must be something special.
I haven't been back for seven years, but the Tohno mansion in my memory is as big as a castle to me.
<Page93>
"That's what I meant. I know it's out of place even for me, but I can't help it now that I've moved."
<Page94>
"Mmm, I guess you aren't too enthusiastic about it after all.
Can't be helped if you haven't been in your old home for seven years. It'll feel like someone else's for a while, right?"
"I wonder. I haven't dropped by yet, so I don't really know how it feels.
Well, if push comes to shove I can always take shelter at your house."
<Page95>
"W-What the hell? Screw you, my house isn't your bivouac spot. During days off, you'd come over to stay overnight. Thanks to that, my sister has become more partial to you, my friend Tohno-kun, than me. Now my allowance is decreasing every year!"
<Page96>
I think it's due to his bad behavior, but I decide not to mention it because it would complicate things.
To be honest, I don't feel comfortable talking about the Tohno family.
<Page97>
"Heeh. You two are really close, aren't you?"
"Not really. Even if we found each other struggling, we'd never join hands. Basically, we're enemies, mademoiselle."
<Page98>
"But he even stays at your house, doesn't he? That's really close."
<Page99>
"That's not it, Senpai. He ran away just because he didn't wanna stay home during summer break. This bastard feels reserved towards the Arima family whom he's entrusted to."
<Page100>
"So, he comes to me when I have a room available. My sister likes him because he's good-looking, and so he comes to stay with no money at all even though he's filthy rich!"
<Page101>
Arihiko shakes his fist as if saying that he won't forgive me.
...I see, so that is the reason why... I'll bring a souvenir or two next time.
<Page102>
"...You were entrusted, Tohno-kun?"
Arihiko covers his mouth in a hurry.
He then awkwardly makes a bitter smile as if something unnecessary has been said.
<Page103>
"Don't worry about it. There's nothing wrong with it really."
I said as I eat the curry rice, without looking at Arihiko's face.
<Page104>
"I see. Well, that's true.
If you complained about that, I would've hit you."
Arihiko nods his head, seemingly convinced. I think this kind of overwhelming optimism is truly a beautiful thing about him.
<Page105>
"...I'm sorry, Tohno-kun.
I mean, did you not get along with your previous family...?"
<Page106>
"No, that's not true. This guy has no problems with the Arima family. They're all super nice people. Well, old man Arima is rather scary, though.
And yet he doesn't accept their kindness and runs away to my place during days off. What's wrong with you, really?"
<Page107>
"I'm not refusing their kindness. They've been good to me, I just don't want to burden them anymore."
<Page108>
I finish my curry rice.
All that's left now is a bowl of curry udon.
Apparently, Senpai is not in good spirits.
<Page109>
"I'm sorry, Ciel-senpai. That was a boring story."
"T-That's not true. I'm sorry for asking you such a strange question."
<Page110>
Senpai forces herself to act cheerful.
This topic might have been fine for a long-time friend like Arihiko but for someone like Senpai, such a complex topic must've been bothersome at best.
In fact, she seems to be fidgeting as if she is uncomfortable.
<Page111>
"Aah, I'm sorry, Senpai. But I've got to talk to Tohno about something in private so can you excuse us for a sec?"
<Page112>
Suddenly, Arihiko makes an outrageous comment.
He's actually trying to phrase things nicely. If he was more blunt, he'd say something like 'You're bothering us Senpai, could you leave?'
<Page113>
"What are you talking about? We can talk in private anywhere, and she hasn't finished eating ye―――"
―――t.
Even though we've been talking most of the time, Senpai has already finished her curry rice.
<Page114>
"No, no, I understand. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'll leave you to it."
After giving a bow, Senpai leaves.
It's just me and Arihiko at the table.
<Page115>
"...Hah. Senpai seemed uncomfortable so it was probably for the best. But that was a close call, wasn't it? Your likability has dropped."
<Page116>
"Hmm, well, that's unavoidable. I'm the one who slipped up, so I should at least get the hate."
Arihiko slurps his udon.
He was so absorbed in the conversation with Senpai that it got cold.
<Page117>
"You were after Senpai, right?"
"It's not just me, everyone's after her. Ciel-senpai is the best at our school.# But well, it's not like she's the type who would mind that kind of conversation we had just now so that doesn't really matter. Oh yeah, I really do have something to talk to you about in private."
<Page118>
".....?"
Arihiko's voice is rather serious.
I break my chopsticks and start eating my curry udon.
<Page119>
"What the hell? You're creepy, acting all serious all of a sudden. Did you do something wrong again?"
"It's not that, damn it. What I want to know is this: what's really going on with you?"
"What do you mean?"
<Page120>
"You've been with the Arima household since primary school, right? I don't know why but it's been seven years, right? Why're they at the Tohno mansion calling back someone who your father disowned?"
<Page121>
"I wasn't disowned.
He just asked me to leave the mansion for some reason."
<Page122>
"Look, Tohno-kun. If there's a family that randomly kicked their child out of the house, it'd be more of a comedy than a tragedy.
But this is one step short of horror! It's so cruel I can't even laugh!"
<Page123>
To tell the truth, even before I was involved in a car accident and hospitalized, I had a bad relationship with my father.
The Tohno family had been a prominent family for a long time, and their way of life was far from the norm.
All I can remember from those days was that huge, Western-style mansion. It was like that place had been frozen in time with period-accurate family principles to match.
<Page124>
The Tohno family was also a wealthy family and shareholders of several companies. My father, Tohno Makihisa, was apparently a mediocre businessman, but the assets he inherited from his grandfather were strong enough to keep the company running smoothly.
<Page125>
An anachronistic building.
The life of the upper class, respecting civility and history.
Such a life in the mansion seemed boring to my childish mind.
That's why, when I was told that I would be left at the Arima house, I accepted without much resistance.
<Page126>
I think it was for the best, in the end.
I got along well with the people of the Arima family, and I treated my stepmother Keiko and stepfather Fumiomi as if they were my real parents.
Originally longing for a normal family, Tohno Shiki lived with the Arima family as though he were their actual son.
<Page127>
I don't think there was any regret in that.
The only thing I regret is that I left behind my younger sister, Akiha.
<Page128>
Akiha must have hated me... Tohno Shiki.
Or rather, she has every right to hate me.
She was left alone in that huge mansion, living with my hard-headed father.
It's easy to imagine how Akiha feels about me running away from her.
<Page129>
"I guess you're right. It's true that if you're kicked out of the house for some reason, you can't help but laugh."
"Right? And on top of that, they've told you never to come back. In the real world, not the world of TV shows, that's called being disowned.
I never asked before. Why'd they disown you?"
<Page130>
"........."
........Who knows.
The problem is that I don't have the answer to that question myself.
<Page131>
"Well, if you don't wanna talk about it, fine."
Arihiko holds the bowl with both hands and drinks the soup down.
The break time is short, so I decide to follow his example and eat my lunch as quickly as possible.
