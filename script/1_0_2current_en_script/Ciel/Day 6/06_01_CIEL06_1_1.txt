"...Yeah. I think that's the best way to do it."//Same as last file, more than half of the file is identical to its Arc side version. I'll be syncing with Tumbling's translation, differences should normally indicate a real difference in JP text
<Page2>
I can't talk about Arcueid or Vlov.
It's not like she would understand, and I don't want her to get involved.
Since I can't tell her the truth no matter what, I'll at least apologize honestly for my faults.
<Page3>
"―――Alright, let's go."
Taking a deep breath, I open the door to the living room.
<Page4>
"Good morning,# Nii-san.# Strangely enough, it feels like# it has been a long time."
Akiha is certainly giving that 'I am angry' look.
Her acerbity has already reached its peak.
<Page5>
"Y-Yo. Morning, Akiha."
"There is no need for greetings, so please take a seat over there.
Yes, it seems that we have a lot to catch up on, don't you think?"
<Page6>
"........"
Akiha's words are so intense that they squashed any objection.
...Still I can't exactly agree with how much fun she seems to be having.
I could tell she was radiating, like she finally caught a criminal red-handed and put him in jail.//Someone recheck this
<Page7>
"―――Nii-san?"
"Y, yeah, I'll take a seat!"
My naive idea of running away vanished with a single glance from Akiha.
<Page8>
I sit down on the sofa, holding back the pain running through my whole body.
<Page9>
"I'm seated now."
"You did not need to say that... Please do not dampen my spirit with your bizarre attitude. It's unfair."
<Page10>
"Why would it be unfair?"
"Of course it's unfair. If you give me a face like that, I'll be rela――――#Ahem."
After stopping her statement with a cough, Akiha glares at me with an even sharper gaze.
<Page11>
"Nii-san. As prompt as this may be, would you mind telling me about what happened yesterday and the day before?"
Akiha picks up the teacup as she speaks with grace.
Although her words resembled a question, it was most definitely closer to an order.
<Page12>
But as her older brother, I can't let her hear such a story. I would much rather have Akiha hate me than worry about me.
<Page13>
"So about that, Akiha."
"Yes, what is it?"
"To be frank, I can't explain the situation."
<Page14>
Crash.
With that, the teacup that Akiha was holding dropped onto the table.
No, it's more accurate to say that she let it drop on purpose.
<Page15>
"Akiha-sama―――"
"Oh, I apologize, Hisui. Could you clean that up for me?"
<Page16>
Hisui silently cleans up the spilled tea and the broken... very expensive looking... teacup.
I uneasily stare at the scene, while Akiha glowers at me.
After cleaning up, Hisui leaves for the kitchen.
<Page17>
"―――So then, Nii-san."
"...What?"
"Would you be so inclined as to tell me more about the events of these past two days?"
<Page18>
Akiha is not giving up.
She is determined to make me talk.
<Page19>
...But even so, I can't talk about the situation.
Even if it's for my own sake, I can't,
I can't let Akiha hear such a story.
<Page20>
"...I'm sorry if I made you needlessly worried. I also apologize about not contacting you. But even so, there are some things that I cannot talk about."
<Page21>
"So you say that you feel bad, and yet you won't say anything, Nii-san.
Do you not even have an excuse?"
<Page22>
"...No, well..."
As much as I'd like to explain myself,
"I don't have a good excuse...
But I haven't done anything wrong in the past two days... That, I want to believe in."
<Page23>
...That's right. Those two days were nothing but kill or be killed.
Despite that, I want to believe that I made the right choice.
<Page24>
There is also the reason of wanting to help Arcueid, but above all, I have no regrets in having made my own choices.
Even though I didn't act fast enough, at least no one else will be killed from having their blood sucked from now on.
<Page25>
"...Sorry, Akiha.
I know it's frustrating, but please don't ask any more questions."
"―――――"
Akiha stares into my eyes.
The suffocating atmosphere persists for a little while longer.
<Page26>
"Is that so.
Come to think of it, you do have your own circumstances, and it is not my place to meddle deeply into your affairs."
"...Sorry. I really appreciate you saying that."
"――――"
