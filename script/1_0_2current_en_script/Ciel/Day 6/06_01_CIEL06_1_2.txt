I guess I have no choice but to deceive her somehow.//This file, up to page 12, also has similar parts to Ciel06_1_1
In the first place, she'll never believe a story about vampires. I don't want to lie to her if possible, but having said that, I can't tell her the truth. So that's the only course of action left to me.
<Page2>
"―――Alright, let's go."
Taking a deep breath, I open the door to the living room.
<Page3>
"Good morning,# Nii-san.# Strangely enough, it feels like# it has been a long time." 
Yeah, as expected.
Opening the door, I find that the Boss is waiting for me.
<Page4>
"A-Ah, good morning, Akiha"
"There is no need for greetings, so please take a seat over there.
Yes, it seems that we have a lot to catch up on, don't you think?"
<Page5>
"......."
She has a smile on that desperately makes me want to go back to bed. 
I'm like a frog that's being stared at by a snake, no, like one that's already been swallowed.
This is the wrong route, I just want to rewind to my bed and start over.
<Page6>
"—————Nii-san?#"
"O-Oh, I'll take a seat!"
My naive idea of running away vanished with a single glance from Akiha.
<Page7>
I sit down on the sofa, holding back the pain running through my whole body.
<Page8>
"I'm seated now."
<Page9>
"You did not need to say that... Please do not dampen my spirit with your bizarre attitude. It's unfair."
"Why would it be unfair?"
"Of course it's unfair. If you give me a face like that, I'll be rela――――#Ahem."
After stopping her statement with a cough, Akiha glares at me with an even sharper gaze.
<Page10>
"Nii-san. As prompt as this may be, would you mind telling me about what happened yesterday and the day before?"
Akiha picks up the teacup as she speaks with grace.
Although her words resembled a question, it was most definitely closer to an order.
<Page11>
But as her older brother, I can't let her hear such a story. I would much rather have Akiha hate me than worry about me.
<Page12>
"So about that, Akiha."
"Yes, what is it?"
"I just unexpectedly met a passing acquaintance, who wanted to do some sightseeing, so I showed them around a bit"
<Page13>
"Hmmm. A passing acquaintance, is it?"
"Y-Yeah. It's someone I met recently who said they wanted to go around famous places, and that I should go along considering it was just for one day. Before I knew it, we had gone as far as the reclaimed land by the bay coast..."
<Page14>
"I see. So you did not go to school and stayed the night outside, all without permission, because you were nonchalantly asked to by a friend whom you haven't seen in a while.
Like what happened the other day, I see that you like to selflessly help other people, Nii-san."
<Page15>
Akiha's gaze is ice cold.
She may have been so angry that there's only exasperation left. 
Honestly, I'm doubting my own explanation too.
<Page16>
"........"
"........"
"Well, who is it?"
"Eh?"c
<Page17>
"I am asking what kind of person that acquaintance is."
<Page18>
Akiha is directly looking at me.
I could ominously perceive how strong her intention not to be deceived was.
<Page19>
"Ah, 'what kind of person' you ask me, but that's not something I can explain in a few words..."
Anyway, can that woman even be considered a person?//There was an emphasis on <人|・>物, but there's probably no way to reflect that. 
<Page20>
"I see. You won't tell. Meaning that you have something to be guilty of, Nii-san."
Her ice cold stare is piercing. 
As I look away, she'll pressed me even further, so I stare back undauntedly at Akiha. 
<Page21>
........This is completely unrelated but...
Looking at her once more, she has completely changed from when we were young.
She is standing straight, in a dignified manner, her words are clear, and her gaze unwavering.
Letting aside any partiality because we're brother and sister, I am strangely moved to see that she has become a genuinely beautiful woman, 
<Page22>
"...Yeah. But, apart from that, Akiha"
"What it is? Have you come with a little more convincing excuse?"
<Page23>
"No. I was thinking that you have a nice body structure. Thin but also solid, like smooth porcelain."
"—————"
Bump. The table shakes.
It looks like Akiha's legs caught on the table when she suddenly stood up. 
<Page24>
"W-What do you mean by 'body structure'!? Are you talking about my weight!?"
"? No, I was talking about your bone structure. Like the top of your shoulders, or how your clothes look good on you." 
<Page25>
Perhaps understanding what I meant, Akiha quietly sits back on the sofa
<Page26>
"I really don't understand you. Did that surprise you just now?"
"—————I was surprised. It was entirely unconnected to what we were discussing."
Akiha sighs and shrugs her shoulders.
<Page27>
"...Enough already. It appears that you won't give me a serious answer, Nii-san"
"That's not true. I would never lie to you in the first place, Akiha"
Ah... Somehow, the head of the family right here makes a face that almost seems to say 'I will pull out your tongue'
<Page28>
"...I will remain silent though.
But I swear that I'm lying to you. It's just that it's a little complicated to explain this time."
That's why it ended up being an extremely questionable explanation, riddled with holes.
<Page29>
"...Goodness. Ever since we were little, I've never been able to tell whether you were sincere or not, Nii-san"//I don't have the same interpretation of the sentence as Tumbling, needs further check.
<Page30>
"?# I don't remember very much about how I was in the past though"
"It's fine if you don't. It's just... I don't seem to have changed either. 
To be asking such questions when I knew it was going to be like this, perhaps I haven't matured at all."
