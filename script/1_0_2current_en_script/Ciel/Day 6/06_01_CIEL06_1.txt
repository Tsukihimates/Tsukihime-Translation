The gentle rays of the sun dispel my sleepiness.//A large part of this file is the same as the Arc side version. I've sync my version with Tumbling's version. When it differs, it should *normally* indicate that there's a real difference between the two.
Even with my eyes closed, I can feel the silence around me through the sensation of my skin.
The air is just cold enough to push me to wake up.
The sky seems to be the clearest it's ever been today.//どうやら
<Page2>
"...This is,"
My body is laying on the bed, and my glasses are next to my pillow.//I lay on the bed, with my glasses near me, by the pillow.
It's not excessively cold around me, and I don't feel the rubble hurting me in the back anymore.
I open my eyes to a room of the Tohno mansion.
<Page3>
I put on my glasses by reflex and let my gaze wander around.
I take a deep breath and take in# the fresh air. //Another strange #
<Page4>
The hands of the clock make a ticking sound.
I can hear the birds chirping outside.
The sunlight through the window is so pure that I can almost hear it calling me outside.//Here 清らか, Arc side is 鮮やか
<Page5>
"Oh right, I..."
I returned to my normal life.
My thoughts are still foggy, and my joints still ache, but at any rate, I've managed to come back to normalcy.
<Page6>
I've seen such abnormal things, and such a horrible hell, but I can feel that this morning is a blessed moment.
There is no greater reward for a small person like me―――
<Page7>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama.#"
"Uwaaaaah!"
<Page8>
My upper body jumped up before I realized it.//I unconsciously jolt and find myself sitting up on the bed
I look over and see Hisui standing by the door.
<Page9>
"H-Hisui—————"
"...My deepest apologies, Shiki-sama.
It seemed that you were rather unaware of my presence, so I decided to call out to you, but..."
<Page10>
"Ah―――no, well, I'm sorry as well."
I'm surprised.//I would say That surprised me.
My heart is still thumbing...
<Page11>
"...Huh? But it's not even 7 o'clock."
"Yes. It is a little earlier than when you usually wake up, Shiki-sama."
"I guess so. So what brings you all the way here, Hisui?"
<Page12>
"I have come here to wake you up.
I received orders from Akiha-sama to bring you to explain the situation of the past two days, even as far as using force if necessary."
<Page13>
「...What...?」
'Akiha', 'the past two days', 'explain'.
Those three cryptic words fly around inside my brain.
<Page14>
I take ten seconds to think as I resist the temptation to abandon my thoughts.
...No matter how much I consider it, there is no point in explaining what happened these past two days. Absence without consent. Curfew violation. On top of that, lack of communication.
Akiha is scary enough when I don't come home before dusk. I can't even imagine what kind of face she's making right now.
<Page15>
"Cr————"
Crap. This is really bad. I'm up against a wall.
What's the wall? The fact that I can't thing up of an excuse to convince Akiha at this preparatory stage!
<Page16>
"...Hey, Hisui.
To put it mildly, is Akiha, mad at me...?"
<Page17>
"That I wonder.
You will have to find out for yourself, Shiki-sama."
<Page18>
Okay. It seems that Hisui's voice is also somewhat cold for whatever reason.
It it was going to be like this, I should have returned even if I had to crawl—————Wait, crawl?//No 屋敷に
<Page19>
"No, wait a minute.
Before that, why was I asleep in my room, did I...?"
<Page20>
"...No. After your return, you said you were tired and went to your room to rest, Shiki-sama."
<Page21>
"I did? I walked? Until here?"
"Yes. You said to Nee-san, who went to welcome you, 'I'm so tired I could die. Please don't wake me until I get up', or so she told me."
<Page22>
I don't remember any of that... But, it doesn't look like Hisui is telling a lie either.
It could be that Ciel-senpai took me near home, and that I then returned to the mansion on my own by foot. After such a battle, I was probably barely conscious.
<Page23>
"Ah, I mean————"
My memory is still clear.
I remember about Arcueid, and the vampire Vlov, as well as Ciel-senpai and the others.
<Page24>
'I will erase your memories of this day'
That's what Senpai said, but it seems that she let me off the hook.
<Page25>
...Ah, but still.
That probably doesn't change anything to the fact that Senpai and the others will leave the city now that the vampire's disappeared.
<Page26>
"Shiki-sama...?"
"Ah, no, I see. My memory came back.
I'll go there right away, so if you could, well... ask Akiha to calm down as best as possible, I'd appreciate it very much you know?"
<Page27>
"I am deeply sorry. I will endeavour to the best of my abilities, but please keep in mind that it will bear almost no result."
<Page28>
A-Ah, right... Even if Hisui and Kohaku back me up, what's done is done and won't change.
...That being said, I should get up.
I can't begin by staying in bed forever.//There's no point in staying in bed forever.
<Page29>
"————Ugh"
As soon as I stand up, I was struck by a slight dizziness.
<Page30>
...My whole body is hurting.
I guess it's because of the wounds I received here and there yesterday.
Bruises, lacerations, and muscles sore from excessive straining.
Every time I move, my skin tenses up, and I feel a pain like my flesh is slowly burning.
<Page31>
...So that's how it is. If I were to ask myself what I should be surprised about, it would be the fact that I'm still alive.
After doing all those crazy things, it would be unnatural for me to be greeted by the morning like this.
<Page32>
"Shiki-sama...?"
"Sorry, I got dizzy standing up. I'll go change, so please go ahead, Hisui. It's fine, I'll really do it."//すっぽかしたりしないから because I won't do something like breaking my promise/not doing something I said I would do
"...Understood. I will wait for you then."
<Page33>
Hisui deeply bows and leaves the room.
Today is sunday, there's no school.
I take off the school uniform that I've been wearing since yesterday night and change into casual clothes.
<Page34>
Well then, I really don't want to go, but I'm reaping what I sowed.
I prepared myself for the worst and leave for an audience with the Lady Akiha.
