The protagonist is not the only one who faces a dead end.
A merciless end comes even to the heroine.
<Page2>
No one is spared from this story.
And with that being said―――
<Page3>
Let's hear some thoughts from our lovely heroine
who tragically met a brutal end for the second time!//Should probably include the reference to 解体 (dissection) here lest it fall flat that it is the second time.
<Page4>
The stand's all yours Arcueid!
And also congratulations to the next heroine in line!
<Page5>
...You are quite the crude instructor.
Are you aware that you possess a barrier for fundamental reasoning?//Okay this line is completely busted. What Eco-Arc says here that's hidden by the text is 原理血戒（げんりけっかい）, aka Idea Blood/Hemonomic Principle. Basically this is more along the lines of 'And you call yourself a holder of the Idea Bloods?'
<Page6>
...Huh?
Umm, and who might you be...?
<Page7>
Where did that cat-like creature run off to?
I thought she was Arcueid's representative. Huh?
<Page8>
...How utterly wrong.
Not only are you dull, but your intelligence is also lacking.
<Page9>
That creature you speak of is not her alter ego,
nor is it her messenger.//使い魔 should be Familiar, same word used for the familiar of mages.
<Page10>
It is simply an anomaly; a jargon that has been misinterpreted
as an urban legend and started to walk on its own.
<Page11>
If you are seeking for thoughts regarding her demise,
there exists someone more qualified than that creature.
<Page12>
Needless to say, I'm talking about myself.
After all, I'm no stranger to this matter.
<Page13>
...I-It can't be.
<Page14>
The Arcueid before me in this corner is not the cat-like
creature that had been here until now, but...//This might seem minor, but における here is more implying representation. 'This corner's Arcueid-role' or something like that. 'That cat-like creatue that was with me until just now is not this corner's Arcueid, but rather...'
<Page15>
Indeed. The Arcueid Brunestud that is//Going with the last comment: 'Indeed. This corner's Arcueid Brunstud-role... is me.'
present in this corner, is me.
<Page16>
It costs a severe amount of money to have me
appear as an image of the future just like you,
<Page17>
so in order to minimize the cost, I have appeared
as an image of my past.
<Page18>
... That's right.
<Page19>
Since I'm an economical version of Arcueid,
you can call me Eco-Arc.
<Page20>
Eco-Arc...!
<Page21>
Then that means that feline
creature won't appear anymore, right? Woohoo!
<Page22>
Please lower your expectations.
In short, I will only appear on rare occasions.
<Page23>
From here on, and after, for all of eternity,
that creature will become your partner.//'Become' here feels a bit odd. Perhaps just 'be' instead?
<Page24>
Oh, is that so...
I appreciate your declaration of my hellish future...
<Page25>
But then, why is is that
Eco-Arc is here with me this time?
<Page26>
Surely you must be here to complain about
the mess that Tohno-kun made?//人でなしっぷり is not a mess, nor is it appropriate for her to say it here. Shiki has killed Arcueid in this ending, so Ciel is talking about his 'brutish behavior'. Perhaps (both lines): 'Surely you've come to say a thing or two about Tohno-kun's brutish behavior?'
<Page27>
...Perhaps so.
Even I found myself covering my eyes at the end.//'it was a conclusion that even I found myself having to cover my eyes over' is the more literal way to translate this. The current sentence isn't terribly inaccurate, but it feels somewhat off.
<Page28>
...Not only did he succumb into his desires,
but he could not even protect himself afterwards.//This is mostly wrong. 'but to think that he couldn't even deal with his broken self afterwards' is a more literal translation.
<Page29>
With the way things turned out, even I cannot supress my disdain.
I am furious... No, worse. I pity you.
<Page30>
Now then, Ciel-Sensei.
I have a favor to ask.
<Page31>
Y-Yes!?
How may I be of service, ma'am?
<Page32>
If you ever have to fight against that thing,//that thing = Arcueid. Perhaps it would be good to highlight that somehow.
please give it a merciless beating.
<Page33>
After all, you can not become a fine lady until//Instead of generic 'you', perhaps 'one' or even 'she' is more appropriate here, as to not cause confusing as to who is being talked about.
you have at least one traumatic experience.
<Page34>
? I wouldn't have any trouble fighting against//This isn't about having trouble. Ciel is saying she wouldn't hold back against Arcueid. Perhaps (both lines): '? Even if you hadn't told me... it's not like I'd hold back when fighting against Arcueid...'
Arcueid without being told...
<Page35>
Huh? Don't tell me that the one
you are actually talking about is...//Not sure why the reference to 怒っている相手 is lost here. It's unclear if Ciel is talking about the previous lines or whatever if phrased this way. 'Wait, don't tell me the person you were furious at was...' or something like that.
<Page36>
I have nothing else to add to that matter.
I leave him to you from here on out.
<Page37>
As unreliable of an instructor you may be,
I can at least trust you as much as a shelf.
<Page38>
Ehh... what was that about?//Might be good to indicate this is talking about Ciel's confusion regarding the previous line (shelf and what not, weird line).
<Page39>
I'm late, I'm late...!
Neco here, arriving at the speed of light!
<Page40>
That's right,  the speed of light caused me to overtake my
oversleeping self and thus, cancelling out the fact that I was late.
<Page41>
Heya, mornin' Ciel-kun!
Looking sub-heroine-like today too, how splendid!
<Page42>
By the way, did I happen to come here earlier?
<Page43>
I feeeel like that was the case nya~.
To be more precise, a super pretty version me.
<Page44>
I don't think there was anyone here that met that criteria.
More impor - tant - ly...
<Page45>
How would you like to punished for being late?
Burning at the stake, groin split, wooden horse, iron maiden...
<Page46>
We have a variety of methods available,
so the choice is all yours.
<Page47>
Ah. Perhaps you would like to be cut into pieces
and bleed to death just like the original Arcueid?//Perhaps use ruby here to indicate Blade being referenced.
<Page48>
Please stop using words that I've never heard before.
Besides, the only one with dead ends is glasses
<Page49>
Eei.
<Page50>
Uwahh, this Indian is serious! Executing me
just for being late, have you finally shown your true colors!?
<Page51>
Oh no, this was not my original intention,
but there was someone who asked for a favor ♥
<Page52>
The story seemed to be nearing the climax,
so I thought I might as well change the leading role here.
<Page53>
Stoop, even for your modification fetish, this is too far~~!!
What are you going to do if it becomes a habit?
