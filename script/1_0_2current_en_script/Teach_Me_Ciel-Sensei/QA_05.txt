Hmm, where did I put it nya.%{n}
What was I looking for nya.
<Page2>
I can't even remember where I got it from nya.%{n}
Although I bought three of the same one by accident nya.
<Page3>
Oh well, time to throw away everything I don't need!
Nyahaha, in the trash you go!
<Page4>
And while I'm at it, later, doll-protagonist!%{n}//put a dash between doll and protagonist.
E - N - DO - R - PH - IN, let's go!
<Page5>
Hold on a second!%{n}
You can't throw that away!
<Page6>
Eh? Ah, crap.
<Page7>
Ah.....
<Page8>
Ah.....
<Page9>
W-well, it just seems to be a doll at least...%{n}
It shouldn't be a problem... I think...
<Page10>
True, that, nya.%{n}
Welp, guess it was destiny.
<Page11>
Could this... be a sign that the protagonist%{n}
will be launched into the air in a spectacular fashion?
<Page12>
Hahaha. Surely not.%{n}
There's no way that even Tohno-kun would come up with such%{n}a reckless―――
<Page13>
Such a reckless―――
<Page14>
...Oh, he actually did.%{n}
That was rather bold, or should%{n}I say suicidal?//to be rechecked, this devised plan stuff is not clear
<Page15>
If he wants to become a human cannonball, just%{n}leave him to it.
 Mmm, I do like a guy with%{n}a lot of spirit though nya.
<Page16>
Maybe the reason it failed was due to%{n}
the wrong X and Y co-ordinates nya?
<Page17>
All three choices here are equally unreasonable,%{n}//ambitious makes it sound a bit soft, when Ciel is basically saying all of them are basically equally unreasonable.
so it's not as if there's much to differentiate them%{n}in terms of difficulty...//by omitting 'plan' from the previous line, this one makes a bit less sense. There's no dig difference between the plans in terms, difficulty-wise. Essentially.
<Page18>
So please go back to the last choice%{n}
and try a different strategy this time.
<Page19>
The battle against Vlov will soon reach its climax.%{n}
Victory is always within reach... Tohno-kun!
