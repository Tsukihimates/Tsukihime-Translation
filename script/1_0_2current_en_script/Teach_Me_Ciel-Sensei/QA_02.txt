Welcome To My Territory.
 Come on in, you%{n}miserable bad-boy.
<Page2>
If you make a choice while naively thinking,%{n}
"Well, they're both the same," you end up%{n}like this.
<Page3>
Half-hearted Glasses-kun STRIKE! And thus you enter this%{n}rescue corner.//Rather than half-hearted, Shiki is being reprimanded here for his passivity. Whether that comes across well with a word like half-hearted I'm not sure.
 "Teach me, Ciel-Sensei" is about to begin~.
<Page4>
Good afternoon to those who have returned.%{n}
And for newcomers, nice to meet you too.
<Page5>
Most players will be seeing this lesson for%{n}the first time,
 so I'll start by introducing%{n}myself.
<Page6>
I am Ciel, the instructor of this Q&A corner.%{n}
And here with me is my <assistant|s a n d b a g > Neco-Arc.
<Page7>
In each lesson, I will briefly explain the cause of the%{n}dead-end,
 so I hope you will stay until the end.
<Page8>
Usually, the last choice you made was a bad one,
 so all%{n}you have to do is go back and pick the other.
<Page9>
Sometimes there are dead ends that happen because
of a choice made a long time ago, so you can't be too%{n}careful.
<Page10>
We'll explain those cases when the time comes.
 This time,%{n}we have the common "instant death dead end".
<Page11>
When faced with an unusual situation, it is a good idea to%{n}cautiously observe...
 but this time it was not the right call.
<Page12>
After all, there was no way to escape.
<Page13>
Unless you can fly,
 I would not recommend taking up%{n}position on the roof of the hotel.
<Page14>
He could have escaped if he had been a cat.
 Cats can fly%{n}in the air very lightly, you know.//perhaps 'soar through the skies' is a better way of phrasing this, since 飛ぶ is a verb that can mean both 'jump' and 'fly', which contextualises Ciel's response (roof to roof) and thus her confusion.
<Page15>
? When you say 'lightly', what do you mean?%{n}
Like from roof to roof?
<Page16>
But even for a cat,
 flying from%{n}the top floor of a hotel is a%{n}bit...
<Page17>
She pulled out a rocket and%{n}flew...!
<Page18>
I can't take that cat seriously at all!//This is more like, 'she's no help at all'
