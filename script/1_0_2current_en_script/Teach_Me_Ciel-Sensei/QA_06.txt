OS. OS. OS.
Phew.
<Page2>
I've been pressing the O and S keys for 20 hours now.
With all this typing, I could have developed an app by now.
<Page3>
Phew... nothing like a coffee after work.
I can even feel the end of work from the atmosphere alone.//This is minor, but its more like 'It even makes me feel like I've done my work
<Page4>
Now then, as for this morning's dead end...//There's some silliness with the ruby here that is not preserved entirely. 'this morning's Glasses Gazette' with dead-end as the reading. It could be left as it is, too.
Ahh, a direct hit from the enemy I see.
<Page5>
Glasses-kun, could this be...
an attempt to reincarnate into another world?
<Page6>
(How on earth is she pressing the keys with those hands?)
I see...
<Page7>
Since it was as if you had pulled a dump truck onto yourself,
it could be said that this incidient was caused by carelessness.
<Page8>
However, it could also be due to the bad influence from that vampire.
<Page9>
I mean, if you had a unit like an excavator next to you,
it's only human nature to want to use it.
<Page10>
How is that human nature?
And don't call her a unit. It's heroine. Heroine.//perhaps 'me' is better here, since Neko-Arc is the stand-in for Arcueid?
<Page11>
They're basically the same.
In fact, they do the same thing.//This is sorta wrong. It's more like "In fact, you pulled it off" or something like that, as in, she managed to pull in Vlov and get Shiki killed, much like an the heavy-duty machinery she compares Arcueid to. That said, the phrasing would render these lines a bit awkward. Might be worth leaving as it is.
<Page12>
Jeez. It's not like you at all to act
so freely without considering the consequences.
<Page13>
Were you feeling dizzy from all the damage you took?
<Page14>
Nyah. Wasn't he just overly happy//This is not 'he', this is 'she' or 'I' (since it's Neko-Arc talking about herself)
from being relied on so much?
<Page15>
―――I see.
I hope you get kicked to death by a horse.
<Page16>
It seems that half of the blame goes to Tohno-kun
and the other half of the blame goes to Arcueid.
<Page17>
This is no time for playing around.
The climax is right in front of you.
<Page18>
This time, try to choose the option that will
get you as far away from Arcueid as possible!
<Page19>
Ehh~~.
If it was you in that situation, you would have done the same nya~.
<Page20>
Hehe. No way, absolutely not.
I don't have that kind of muscle strength after all.
<Page21>
