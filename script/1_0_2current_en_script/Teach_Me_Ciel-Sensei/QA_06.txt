OS. OS. OS.%{n}
Phew.
<Page2>
I've been pressing the O and S keys for 20 hours now.%{n}
With all this typing, I could have developed an app by now.
<Page3>
Phew... nothing like a coffee after work.%{n}
It even makes me feel like I've actually done%{n}my work.//This is minor, but its more like 'It even makes me feel like I've done my work
<Page4>
Now then, as for this morning's edition of the%{n}Glasses Gazette, ahem, I mean, dead end...%{n}//There's some silliness with the ruby here that is not preserved entirely. 'this morning's Glasses Gazette' with dead-end as the reading. It could be left as it is, too.
Ahh, a direct hit from the enemy I see.
<Page5>
Glasses-kun, could this be...%{n}
your attempt to make it into the next%{n}big isekai anime?
<Page6>
(How on earth is she pressing the keys with those hands?)%{n}
I see...
<Page7>
Since what you did here was like pulling a dump truck onto%{n}yourself,
 one could argue this incident arose%{n}from your own carelessness.
<Page8>
However, it could also be that vampire's bad%{n}influence upon you.
<Page9>
I mean, if you have a powerful machinery unit like an%{n}excavator right next to you,
 it's only human%{n}nature to want to use it for a tricky job.
<Page10>
How is that human nature?
And don't call me a unit. It's heroine. Heroine.//perhaps 'me' is better here, since Neko-Arc is the stand-in for Arcueid?
<Page11>
They're basically the same.%{n}
You did the job, no questions%{n}asked.//This is sorta wrong. It's more like "In fact, you pulled it off" or something like that, as in, she managed to pull in Vlov and get Shiki killed, much like an the heavy-duty machinery she compares Arcueid to. That said, the phrasing would render these lines a bit awkward. Might be worth leaving as it is.
<Page12>
Jeez. It's not like you at all, to act%{n}
so freely without considering the%{n}consequences.
<Page13>
Were you feeling dizzy from all the damage you took?
<Page14>
Nyah. Wasn't I just overjoyed%{n}//This is not 'he', this is 'she' or 'I' (since it's Neko-Arc talking about herself)
to be relied upon so much?
<Page15>
―――I see.%{n}
I hope you get kicked to death by a horse.
<Page16>
It seems that half of the blame lies with Tohno-kun,%{n}
and the other half lies squarely with Arcueid.
<Page17>
This is no time for playing%{n}around.
 The climax is right in%{n}front of you.
<Page18>
This time, try to choose the option that will%{n}
get you as far away from Arcueid as%{n}possible!
<Page19>
Ehh~~.
If it was you in that situation, bet you would have done%{n}the same nya~.
<Page20>
Hehe. No way, absolutely not.
I don't have that kind of muscle strength%{n}after all.
<Page21>
――――――.
