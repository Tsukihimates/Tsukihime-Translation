This is the Q&A corner where we provide guidance to%{n}Tohno-kun,
 who has reached a dead end that he has no%{n}clue about.
<Page2>
It's time for "Teach me! Ciel-Sensei!".%{n}
Good evening. Instructor Ciel here.
<Page3>
God Cat.//(TL: I am the god of cats.) This shows up in the bottom right corner as a graphic so will be translated separately and doesn't need to be part of Neco-Arc's declaration haha.
<Page4>
Now then. About the cause of death this time,%{n}
how do you explain what just happened, God?
<Page5>
Don't ask me, I'm just a God.%{n}//'I'm a god so I dunno' is what she actually says. That said, it sure is RANDOM and WACKY to make such a dumb statement so it might come across as making no sense. Don't worry though, that's how Neko-Arc is.
It's not like there were any%{n}choices right beforehand.//She's saying there wasn't any choice immediately before the dead end. 'Besides, there wasn't any choices right before.'
<Page6>
Right, this is quite the rare case.%{n}
This is an outcome that occurred due to a much earlier%{n}choice.
<Page7>
It was morally wrong for you to lie to members of your%{n}household,//The one being lied to that leads to this end is Hisui (not family), and the word used here is お家の方, that is 'person from your house'. Perhaps "It is morally wrong to lie to someone from your home" is good enough?
 let alone go investigating so late at%{n}night.
<Page8>
If you know about the choice that I'm referring to,%{n}
then go back to that choice and be more sincere.
<Page9>
Lying is bad, honesty is king nya.%{n}
Yup, yup. That's exactly right.
<Page10>
C'mon, take a good look at my beautiful self,%{n}
who looks just like that vampire heroine...
<Page11>
After all, a true heroine should never%{n}lie
 or have anything to hide.
<Page12>
Hey, isn't that right, Ciel-sensei?
<Page13>
Speaking of which, is there something that%{n}
you would like to share with us nya~?
<Page14>
―――Tch!
<Page15>
Nya nya nya, it's useless～☆%{n}
You'll never land a hit on my true heroine heart nya～☆
<Page16>
Oof oof wah st- sto- nyagh-
<Page17>
Haah... well, aren't you nimble...%{n}//'Haah... well aren't you nimble' is more the implication here.
I see... I guess we were... evenly matched...
<Page18>
Well, now that's done and dusted, that's%{n}all for now!//more like 'that's all for now'
 Let's meet again at the%{n}next dead end lesson!
<Page19>
Ack... you hide a mean right hook along with your weight%{n}and weapons, ugh....//Here Neko-Arc is saying that Ciel in usual cases only hides her weapons and weight. I guess the implication is that she hid her mad punching skillz too?
