Hmm? It seems that after day 10 started as usual,
we went to school as usual and then the game just ended.
<Page2>
What the heck is going on Ciel?
An error? Is there nothing else after this nya?
<Page3>
No matter how I see it, there weren't any bad choices nya...//he didn't TAKE any bad choices.
Eh? You broke a promise with your sister?
<Page4>
But the promise with that blonde beauty is more important right?
I'm pretty sure this was the correct route too, but why...?
<Page5>
What are you talking about?
<Page6>
With how much Akiha-san had worried about you,
you still decided to go out. You failed as an older brother.
<Page7>
Although you have already collapsed many times until now,
today you are experiencing a more peculiar illness.
<Page8>
You won't be able to recover without a half day of rest,
so make sure you rest properly okay?
<Page9>
Of course, it is completely okay to miss
the meeting with Arcueid.
<Page10>
Since the promise was made orally, it is not
legally enforceable and thus not punishable ♥//'it is neither legally enforcable nor cause for penalty fees' is a more accurate translation. This is not a big deal though. I'd be fine to leave it as it is.
<Page11>
But this ain't an issue of legality nya~.
It's a matter of what's right in our hearts nya~.
<Page12>
But if this ends up with them breaking up,//This is probably not the right phrasing. Neko-Arc is alluding to how missing the promise with Arcueid here (which you must, to avoid this dead-end) leads to further developments with Arcueid's romance.
perhaps a new romance will be formed... ehehe...//As with the above comment, 'a new romance' being formed gives the wrong implication. She means the next romantic moment, or whatever. 'Yet their hearts passing eachother by is what would birth the next moment of romance' perhaps (this is for both of these lines).
<Page13>
It's here... I feel it...
I can feel a date event right around the corner...!
<Page14>
Oh right. Ciel's the only without a date event, right?//no 'only' here. 'Oh right. Ciel doesn't have a date event.'
Sorry... for being too blessed, that is.//'privileged' instead of 'blessed' is probably a more natural sounding translation.
<Page15>
Oh not at all. In fact, we spend an extraordinary amount of time
together at school as well and not only at night, so don't mention it.
<Page16>
If you look at the ratio of time talking with Tohno-kun
which is 4:6, you can see that I'm ahead.
<Page17>
Huuh?
Isn't most of it just you explaining the church stuff?
<Page18>
It's not as long as the lecture on the vampire hierarchy.
<Page19>
In our case, it was simply a pure, platonic conversation
between a lost junior and his reliable senior.
<Page20>
If you're talking about school, I was there too.
<Page21>
But that was more you trespassing, wasn't it?
<Page22>
Well I also had cool clothes like the battle outfit.
<Page23>
Ah, you mean that dress you used again Vlov? (laughs).//即落ち、as in 'instant defeat', has been exluded here. 'Oh the one you immediately lost with against Vlov'
At least the transformation sequence was nice (laughs).
<Page24>
You're dead, punk!
<Page25>
Come at me!
