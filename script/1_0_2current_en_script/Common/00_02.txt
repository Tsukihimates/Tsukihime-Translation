As everyone sleeps, my eyes open to the night's cold air.
It's pitch black tonight.
There is no one in the house.
<Page2>
The domestic smell of tatami mats and shoji paper.
A sky inlaid with a parquet of stars.
The specters of shadows hang from the corners of the room like sludge.
A silence devoid of a single note.
Not even the familiar sound of rustling clothes.
<Page3>
I stand completely still, idly waiting for anyone.
In the dead silence, I remember the past.
The dreams I was having were nothing but what ifs.
For example,
<Page4>
No matter how long you wait, there is no end.
The night sinks deeper and deeper.
By now, I know for sure there isn't a single soul left in the house.
I'm so afraid of being alone. I want to see everyone.
I went out into the garden, all alone.
<Page5>
Every time I exhale, my breath gets whiter and whiter.
It's so cold in the garden; my fingertips are burning.
Frozen stars.
Deep darkness.
The cold light that illuminates the world.
<Page6>
The thicket of grass. The feeling of crushing it under my feet. The lonely sound of my sandals.
The garden of the mansion is very large.
Enclosed in an unpleasant darkness.
The trees in the forest are so black.
They may as well be a giant curtain.
<Page7>
Just like some theater somewhere.
The throbbing in my chest feels like it's blocking my throat.
With a whoosh, the window in the treetops opens.
The 'show' is about to start and I'm trembling with excitement.
<Page8>
The sounds of buzzing insects worm their way into my ears.
There are various, indistinguishable sounds far off in the distance.
At the core of that vast, black curtain.
I can hear everyone having a good time in the forest.
But the curtain still hasn't opened yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
<Page9>
Unable to hold myself back any longer, I entered the forest.
<Page10>
It's really dark.
The forest is so deep that not even the cold light reaches in here.
So many sounds.
So many things.
But it's so dark, I can't make out anything.
If I passed someone along the way, I wouldn't even be able to remember.
<Page11>
It's just so cold.
A winter cold that makes the core of my eyeballs go numb.
I felt as though someone was calling my name.
I walked further in.
<Page12>
After passing through the veil of trees,
I see everyone gathered in a clearing, waiting.
Yet all their forms are disjointed. Devoid of structure.
Their hands and feet are scattered. Torn limb from limb.
The entire clearing is painted in the deepest red.
<Page13>
A stranger emerges from the other side.
Coming this way with a deadly weapon in hand.
He looks like he wants to tear me apart, just like everyone else.
<Page14>
I dimly gaze in the stranger's direction.
At a total loss for what to do, I can only await that weapon.
However, at the last second, someone jumps in front of me.
And in my place, their figure is torn to shreds.
<Page15>
Splash.
Something warm hits my face.
Red.
Red water. Red like a tomato.
That person, torn apart and dismembered.
The person who I called 'Mother',
will never call out my name again.
<Page16>
...I really can't understand any of this.
It's just that I'm so cold.
I felt like I was about to cry.
<Page17>
I didn't want to look at the forest because it was black.
And I didn't want to look at the ground because it was red.
So I raised my gaze to the heavens.
<Page18>
The warm scarlet color bleeds into my vision.
It seeps into the back of my eye sockets.
But it doesn't bother me at all.
The night sky has naught but a single moon.
<Page19>
That stranger, he's
coming to tear me apart this time.
The sounds of his footsteps are gradually approaching.
And yet, somehow it all feels vague.
I gaze unceasingly into the azure haze above.
<Page20>
It's awfully strange.
I don't know why I didn't notice it before.
<Page21>
   Aah... the moon, it's so-
<Page22>
Before I realize it, that stranger is standing before me.
Without a sound, a thud of pain runs through me.
It's at the center of my chest.
Like an opened, dancing veil.
<Page23>
I can't see anything.
The world is gradually disappearing.
Yet, in the midst of it all, it still shines beautifully.
<Page24>
Ah... I hadn't noticed.
The moon...
it's so... beautiful... tonight.
