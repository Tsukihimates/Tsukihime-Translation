<Page1>
I go through a deserted corridor.
A fiery sunset dyes the hallway red.
<Page2>
The autumn sun is falling down in torrents.
In less than a few minutes the world will change. The night is coming.
The sky is already dark.
The boundary between black and red.
Neither day nor night, it is an ambiguous time.
<Page3>
"―――Ah"
I glance up at the sky from the corridor.
The moon was already raised in the sky.
Showing it's perfect circular <shape|face>.
<Page4>
"…………"
Slightly distracted, I looked up at the moon.
<Page5>
Silver moon.
Embossed, glass-crafted beauty.
The white face, so clear it seemed to spill out of the sky.
<Page6>
When I was a child, I saw such a moon
When I was in a <deep sleep|coma>, #I used to #stare at it.
<Page7>
――――Badump.
"Ghh…………!?"
Suddenly, an old wound in my chest ached.
<Page8>
――――Patump.
My heart bounces remarkably.
The blood vessels in my body became active, and my breathing became erratic.
<Page9>
――――Badump.
When I touch my chest.
I feel the uniform is turning bright red.
The wound opened up and is bleeding.
<Page10>
――――Patump.
"Ha--a, ha, HA----."
My breathing is disturbed.
Chills running up my spine are like ice.
It hurts so much that my spine feels like it's going to burst out of my skin.
<Page11>
―――Badump.
―――Patump.
―――Ba, dum.
―――Pa, tum
――――――Ka, tun.
In the middle of the heartbeat, there was a hard sound.
<Page12>
"A――――――"
Someone is coming.
A long shadow crawls across the floor from the end of the corridor.
Katun, katun, cold footsteps echoed.
<Page13>
---Something's wrong.
It's not the same as the stormy threat of the Vlov.
A latent fear that comes not from <outside world|exterior>, but from <inner world|interior>, pulses through my body.
<Page14>
A <flash|slab> runs through my skull.
The pain. The sense of danger directed at me.
I have a feeling that I, Shiki Tohno, should not meet that shadow alone----
<Page15>
"―――、――――――"
He stops.
It's too late to run away. If I show my back, it's over.
I take off my glasses, breathing unsteadily.
I <draw out|pull out> the <sword|knife> hidden in my back.
<Page16>
A figure is approaching.
A tall man.
The "lines" that flutter over his body are surprisingly few and are difficult to see.
On the other hand, the pulsating " point " in the centre of the body is <disturbing|ominous>.
Like a heart, it beats and beats and beats, singing of immortality.
<Page17>
"―――――――――――――――――――――"
I stop breathing.
A series of <questions|whys> intersected.
I don't know that person.
I don't know him, but --- I can't help feeling that he looks like someone else.
Clunk, clunk.
The man is getting closer.
Soon, I will see his face clearly.
<Page18>
"―――――――――――――――――――――"
Who do you resemble?
Who do you resemble?
Who do you resemble?
Who am I forgetting? ------
<Page19>
The man's feet stop.
He is still far away. The red sunlight obscures his face.
But shining <brightly|deeply> are the two eyes of a serpent, looking for its prey.
<Page20>
"In my opinion, human life is like a book without a subject."
It was a cheerful voice.
It was a voice so calm, yet so disgusting that it sent chills down my spine.
I don't know of any other sound that is so chilling and disgusting that it makes me want to puke.
<Page21>
"The book is so small you can hold it in one hand.
The paper is so fragile that it becomes hazy with age.
It is wet with water. It is scorched by fire. It gets torn apart with your own hands.
The past is an illusion <falsified|altered> with false <records|events>.
However―――”
<Page22>
Knife at the ready.
Crouching down. <Grasping|Seeing> distance.
Instinct tells me that there is no time to think, no time to hesitate.
However, reason is too stubborn.
I couldn't switch my mind to killing him for just one breath.
<Page23>
"You, as an individual, are just another incomplete text.
Life is too vague.
Are you aware of that? Tohno... Shiki."
"...Huh?!"
<Page24>
I run through a <weir|barrier>.
It's too late now, I think impatiently, to hit the maximum speed.
An unprecedented display of athleticism.
Nearly 10 metres in a single breath, I cut the line...
<Page25>
"――――――"
However, it was still too late.
My breath was all it took.
In the blink of an eye, he slipped behind me.
<Page26>
"――――――"
In no time.
The man strikes my hand and takes the knife.
His eyes glow blue as he looks directly at the lines of my body.
<Page27>
It's like I'm the only one in slow motion.
He turned up the corners of his mouth in amusement.
"Shame on you.
You're not the only one who gets the privilege of seeing death."
He swung my knife down at my body.
<Page28>
The spine chills.
The brain freezes.
The body remembers the pain of what was done to it before.
"―――――――――――a"
The sound of ripping flesh.
The white steel pierced my chest as if it were paper.
<Page29>
My body collapses.
My whole body loses strength and collapses on the floor.
In the middle of that.
I look up and see the man's face.
<Page30>
"――――――"
The darkness in front of my eyes.
A man's face. I don't know this face.
And yet, I remember it. I remember the flow of his blood.
<Page31>
Because this guy...
That summer day, in front of me.
He is the <future|form> of that boy who was covered in blood.
<Page32>
I fell to the floor with a thud.
Mysteriously, there was no pain or bleeding.
The knife is stuck in my chest.
But my body temperature is dropping. My consciousness is fading away. All the control of my body is disappearing.
<Page33>
"The debt for which you were killed, I have returned. You no longer have any reason to regret.
Time to for the book to burn, Tohno―――<SHIKI|四季>"
<Page34>
The man is sending his words towards the void.
Oh... how could I have forgotten all this time?
When I was a child.
I remember myself, Akiha, and another child playing in Tohno's mansion.
<Page35>
We have always been together.
Whenever I played with Akiha, I always joined her with him, so why did I----
Why did I forgot his name until now.
<Page36>
"SHI...KI."
"Indeed, Shiki. It's been a long time.
Well, but it's a bit too late for that.
The owner of this body, SHIKI Tohno, has disappeared. #By completing his revenge on you."
<Page37>
The man speaks. Speaks the name of a man with the same pronunciation, but a different word.
Tohno SHIKI.
SHIKI. Shiki. Akiha. SHIKI. SHIKI. Akiha. Shiki.
The trace of such a sketch comes back to my mind.
<Page38>
"You're..."
"Yes, I am. I am your objective.
A vampire reincarnated in this body. Princess's adversary.
And that's just for tonight."
<Page39>
A sickening laugh and the discomfort that I had felt so much from Vlov.
In my fading consciousness, I realize.
This is the enemy of Arcueid.
