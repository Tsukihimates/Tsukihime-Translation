"'Well... I'll take that knife, then.
 You won't be needing it when you're gone."
<Page2>
Roa's hand reaches for the knife in his chest.
He grabs the handle and pulls it out.
The moment he pulls it out, I'll be dead for sure.
There's nothing I can do about it.
My body would not move at all, I can not even close my eyelids anymore.
<Page3>
"―――――――"
It disappeared.
Suddenly, Roa's body disappeared from view.
At the same time, a figure in monastic robes appeared.
It was the one that broke through the third floor window and came tumbling in.
<Page4>
"――――――"
"――――――<Ⅹ|Decem>"
<Page5>
「...... Is it a thunderbolt by numerological gates?
 It appears that they have been completely replaced, Roa.」
"......Sen......pai?"
<Page6>
Senior... That's right, this is Ciel-senpai.
The one who's supposed to be gone is confronting that vampire as if she's protecting me...
<Page7>
".................."
They are both very strong.
Provided that the sun has not yet set.
―――And then.
Suddenly Roa began to laugh, as if he had realised something.
<Page8>
"―――Fu, hahahahahahaha!"
<Page9>
"So that's what it is, woman! I hadn't even thought of this <situation|case>!
Wonderful, that's why. I've been reincarnating for eight hundred years and I've made one or two exceptions, but this is why we finally met!"
<Page10>
Roa continues to laugh, heartily amused.
......Senpai just stared at the vampire in silence.
<Page11>
"What's the matter? You're here to kill me, aren't you?
Or what? Still thinking there's nothing a shell can do??"
"――――――"
<Page12>
Senpai didn't answer.
She turned her gaze away from the vampire and picked up my slumped body.
<Page13>
"Oh. So you're saying that this imposter is more important than breaking the causality with me.
However, it's useless. He can't be saved anymore."
<Page14>
"I gave him back exactly what Tohno Shiki had done to him until now.
No matter what kind of treatment you use, it's meaningless to those who have had their death lines cut.
Even the Princess had to trade eight hundred years of her life to be revived. There is no way for a mere mortal to escape 'death'."
<Page15>
Only mocking sounds can be heard.
Senpai is biting her lips and holds back her rage for that vampire.
She is now swallowing the killing intent that wants to go out right now.
...... It is.
It is to protect me when she helps me up.
<Page16>
""Oh, I understand. Congratulations on your reincarnation.
I've been waiting for this moment. We meet at last,、Valdamjong""
A child's voice echoed from the senpai's chest.
Is that ...... Mario's voice being played through the microphone.....?
<Page17>
"Who are you? You seem to be taking it quite easy on me."
""I'm the acting priest sent to this city.
My name is Mario Gallo Bestino.
That should make sense to you, you bloody snake.""
<Page18>
"Bestino...... Laurentius' illegitimate son, right?
Well, I'm surprised you're still alive.
Apparently, you're having some fun over there, aren't you?"
<Page19>
""Yeah, thanks to you, old man is still batshit crazy.
......And what about you？ You、are you fully Valdamjong?
I assume your reincarnation was a success? If not, don't be shy, I'll stop the church's support for another seven days, so go ahead and wake up.""
"......Change your behavior, acting priest. It is a crime against the Church."
<Page20>
""I don't want to be told by you, Ciel.
You can relax, I'll kill the dead without exception. But before that, there's a treasure I need to pick up. Speaking of the secret orders of the old man, the clever you would agree, right?
......So how's it going, Serpent of Akasha? Did you remember it correctly this time? Where is the Dharma of Liberation?""
<Page21>
"Have you grown so old that you need immortality, Laurentius?
But I am certain that I have left you a note.
I wrote to you that you would never achieve full immortality as a man.
If the thieves who rifled through my archives did not take my advice, they had only themselves to blame."
<Page22>
""......don't be so arrogant. It's just that you've left it unfinished.
.........Then, is that it? Isn't there an immortality that the old man wishes for?""
<Page23>
"Unfortunately. My research has switched to the field of the soul.
The study of the body is a poor choice. It's all theory and no practice.
Such uncertain rituals cannot be called magecraft. It's called a curse, Bestino."
""............you mean?""
<Page24>
"It was a waste of time. There is no solution to aging. Stay healthy at best. Suffer until death."
<Page25>
......dreadful silence.
Mario's disappointment could be felt even through the microphone. Disappointment. Hatred. Anger.
<Page26>
"" ............You said it was a curse, Valdamjong.""
"That's what I said. They are the foundation of the magic I developed.
Even if the Holy Church is not familiar with magic, the acting priest will know its origins."
<Page27>
""...... Pull up, Ciel. We'll kill him later. We'll crush this snake bastard with sheer numbers.""
<Page28>
Ciel holds me in her arms and puts her foot on the frame of the window that she has broken.
......Vampire overlooks it with a thin smile.
<Page29>
"...I don't care, you can leave. I'm a busy man.
Now that I am on earth as the Roa, the Princess will visit soon.
I have to make sure I'm ready to welcome her."
<Page30>
Senpai turned her back on the vampire and jumped out of the third floor.
<Page31>
The height of three floors didn't seem to mean much to her.
She landed on the ground with a light footstep and left the school without looking back.
<Page32>
―――In the middle of it.
I was looking at that man with empty eyes.
...... the same name as the child in my memory.
A vampire named Roa overrode a human named SHIKI Tono who had once lived.
<Page33>
Senpai arrived at Tohno's residence in a straight line with me in her arms.
...... I don't know what she's trying to do, but hey, that's not good.
I have a knife stuck in my chest and I'm definitely dying. If Akiha sees me like that, it's more than enough to make her worry.―――――
<Page34>
"――――――"
...... Damn it, I can't speak.
I wanted to tell her to stop, but my throat was barely able to breathe.
<Page35>
"Please keep your mouth shut, Tono-kun!
......Don't worry, your sister is sure to be able to help you......!"
<Page36>
"――――――"
...... It's impossible to help, Senpai.
I''ve been stabbed in the chest with a knife, and I can't even move my body anymore.
.......There is no one who can help a dying person like that.
<Page37>
"No, she can. It would be unreasonable to think otherwise.......! Look, if she was not able to save you, you would have died seven years ago in the first place.
So I'm sure you can still make it this time. ......!"
<Page38>
......Senpai, what do you mean by that......
"It's okay, just shut up!
You can't really keep it up if you talk any more!"
<Page39>
I've never seen such a serious look on her face before.
 ......I felt so bad about it, I closed my eyes.
 ............ Well, anyway.
 ........................That's enough.
 It is hard for me to stay awake, so...
