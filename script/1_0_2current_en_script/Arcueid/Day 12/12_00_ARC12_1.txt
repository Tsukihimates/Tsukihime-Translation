I woke up to the sound of Hisui's voice.
I'm sure――― I've slept in my room since then after returning to the mansion.
......I sigh at the headache that echoes from my eyeballs to my brain.
It doesn't matter, but it's also a habit.
I reached under the pillow and put on my glasses.
<Page2>
"Shiki-sama...... are you feeling unwell in any way?"
"No, I'm fine. Good morning, Hisui."
<Page3>
I replied and got up from the bed.
...... I'm surprised at myself.
Although I don't want to eat anything, my body tries to live life as usual.
<Page4>
"Breakfast? Don't worry, I'll be right there."
"...Yes. We' ll be waiting for you."
<Page5>
Hisui leaves the room looking like she wanted to say something else.
I check my phone. No text messages. The day of the week is Monday.
It's hard to believe, but I' ve been resting in bed all day since I got home on Saturday night. I guess I was tired after a long day.
I changed into my school uniform and headed for the dining room.
<Page6>
After breakfast, I stopped by the living room.
As usual, Akiha and Kohaku-san are here.
"Good morning."
I sat down on the sofa and looked at the clock for no reason.
<Page7>
"......Brother? Well, it's good that you're up so early, but #you know you have school today, don't you?"
"Yeah...? Oh, that's right.
I've got to go to school."
<Page8>
I had forgotten.
Since I didn't have to do anything, I vaguely thought that I would continue to rest.
<Page9>
"......I have my own life, don't I? If I don't have anything to do, I'll just go to school."
"Nii-san...?"
<Page10>
Akiha gives me a suspicious look.
I can't think of any excuses or explanations at the moment.
In the end, I left the house in silence.
<Page11>
Time flies by without a hitch.
I'm sitting in class for the hundredth time, with no purpose.
The clacking of chalk.
I unconsciously copy the mathematical formulas written on the blackboard into a notebook.
<Page12>
Suddenly, I look out of the window at the schoolyard.
I think I've done this before.
Of course, there was no one there.
<Page13>
"――――――"
―――I don't know what I'm doing here.
What am I doing here, sitting quietly in a classroom?
I don't even look for her, I'm just a normal student again.
<Page14>
But I have no way or means to find Arcueid.
There's no chance of me finding her now that she dissappeared.
So, really.
I've lost Arcueid...
<Page15>
"............"
I heard a noise on my desk.
It was nothing special.
It just gripped the sharpie too hard and broken it.
