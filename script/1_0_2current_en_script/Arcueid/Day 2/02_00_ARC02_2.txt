It's after school now#.
I didn't feel any anemic dizziness today, and at least for me, the rest of the afternoon went by peacefully.
However, an unprecedented virus has infected the classroom, and until a short while ago, the air was filled with unrest.
<Page2>
The girls referred to this disturbance among the boys in the class as 'Noel Fever'.
It could also be called 'Noel Measles'.
The conflict between the boys that are delirious with Noel Fever and the girls that looked on coldly didn't stop even for lunch, and the battle will carry on tomorrow.
<Page3>
On the other hand, the boys who didn't catch Noel Fever were praised by the girls' group, but branded as impotent, traitorous, and inappropriately fond of little girls by the boys' group. It's a rather silly story.
<Page4>
"...Well, she's certainly not the type of beauty you see too often, that Noel-sensei."
<Page5>
But I still don't understand why everyone is so crazy about her.
If you're talking about beauty, Akiha is much more―――
<Page6>
"Ah, there you are. Got a minute, Shiki-kun?"
The person who is the center of this turmoil arrives with unbelievable timing!
<Page7>
"Oh. You've got a face like your heart's about to leap out of your mouth.
Were you thinking something indecent?"
<Page8>
"N-No, nothing like that, not at all.
...Um. Leaving that aside, what can I do for you, Noel-sensei?"
Swallowing the guilt of comparing Noel-sensei to Akiha, I try my best to calmly change the subject.
<Page9>
However...
She smiles like she can see right through me.
<Page10>
"...Fufu. I like the sound of 'Noel-sensei'. It's much better than being called senpai.
I'm still getting used to Japan, so I'm a little nervous, but I think I'll get addicted to being called 'Sensei' by a naive boy like you. ―――It's kind of dirty and a little bit exciting."
<Page11>
"Um, Noel-sensei...?
Y-You're a bit too close―――"
<Page12>
"Don't worry about it. In fact, you should just keep quiet and pretend to be dull at a time like this.
Hey, look...... my neck, isn't it beautiful?"
<Page13>
Is it the tension, or the magic of the setting sun?
Her voice slips into my ear, not from the front, but from right behind me, as if she were whispering directly to me.
<Page14>
"Don't be so cautious.
...Just intertwine your fingers with mine. Just share in our warmth. Just lean into my body.
...Yes. I just want you to devour me..."
<Page15>
Her breathing comes closer. Our legs tangle together. She wraps her arm around my back to block my escape.
―――In my field of vision.
The strangely captivating, smooth neck of a woman―――
<Page16>
"...Look... the sound of my heartbeat alone is making you melt, right...?
So just forget about it, forget about yourself, forget about... everything that's in the way, take it all away... the formalities, the glasses―――"
<Page17>
Her snake-like fingers touch the frame of my glasses.
Just then, my body recoils with fear simply at the thought of 'seeing'.
<Page18>
"Just kidding! It was just a little joke to break the ice ♡.
In Japanese terms, you could call it a bit of skinship? Or more like exchanging business cards? Mmm, either way, it's just a bit of socializing between us, OK?"
<Page19>
"...Noel-sensei, that was a joke?"
...I don't think that's the right word for what just happened.
For a teacher, that kind of prank is way too much―――
<Page20>
"...What did you need me for, anyways?
You sounded like you were looking for me."
<Page21>
"Ah, that's all right now. I just needed your help with something, but it's already taken care of.
See you later Shiki-kun. Be careful not to end up like Toyama-sensei."
<Page22>
Noel-sensei waves her hand as she walks away.
I can't stop thinking about what she just said―――
C:>I asked after Toyama-sensei.
C:>...But I decide to give it up.
