I'm going to visit Kohaku-san's room.
While on my way to the bathroom earlier, I was able to get an idea of where Kohaku-san's room is.
<Page2>
I move towards the end of the corridor on the first floor of the west wing.
It is in the opposite direction of the lobby, and the kitchen should be at the end of this corridor.
It seems that Kohaku-san has a small room in front of the kitchen.
<Page3>
"Kohaku-san's room is...this one?"
I knock on the door.
"Kohaku-san, are you there?"
<Page4>
"Yes, just a moment, please."
I hear a cheerful voice from inside the room.
After about two minutes, she comes out.
<Page5>
"Is that you, Shiki-san?
What are you doing at this hour?"
"Um, well. ...Actually, I was wondering if you could let me watch your TV."
"Pardon?"
<Page6>
"Ah, you know, this mansion doesn't have a TV, right?
I've been living in a normal house up until now, and watching TV before going to bed has always been a routine for me, and I don't feel comfortable unless I watch something..."
<Page7>
...The more I talk about it, the more I realize I'm doing something incredibly stupid.
It's really weird to go into a girl's room and ask her to let you watch her TV.
<Page8>
Even Kohaku-san is looking at me in disgust―――― or maybe not?
<Page9>
"Now that you mention it, that's true.
You've been living in the Arima house until now. The atmosphere in this mansion must have been quite heavy all of a sudden, right?"
<Page10>
"Um, let's see...have you told Akiha-sama or Hisui-chan about this?"
"By 'this', you mean about me coming to your room?"
Kohaku-san nods.
<Page11>
"No, I haven't told anyone."
<Page12>
"That's very good. If you had, I would have needed to send you away."
She replies with a smile while looking around the hallway.
<Page13>
"Fortunately, there's no one around.
Now, please come in so we don't get spotted."
She grabs my arm.
"Wait, w-w-woah...!?"
<Page14>
The inside of the room is quite different from what I had expected.
Half of the room is occupied by tatami mats, with a bunch of tansu chests closely packed in the back. That's the only part of the room that is completely Japanese.
On the other hand, the other half of the room while still simple, is westernized, reminiscent of a school infirmary rather than a room in a Western-style building.
<Page15>
"Sit wherever you like.
I'll go make some tea."
Kohaku-san leaves the room.
<Page16>
"......"
'Ahem', I clear my throat and sit down on the tatami... I mean, the sofa on the wooden flooring.
<Page17>
Kohaku-san's room looks more like a well-organized office than a girl's room.
All of the drawers in the chest at the back are very small.//maybe cabinet is better, chest makes me think of a treasure chest
They can only hold about as much as you can fit in the palm of your hand.
<Page18>
"That chest, could it be...?"
Isn't this a chest for storing medicine?
...I think so. When I was living in the Arima house, there was a chest just like this in the room of the old town doctor that took care of me.
<Page19>
If that's the case...then is Kohaku-san also a certified doctor...?
No, I don't think so. She is too young to qualify as a doctor.
<Page20>
When I look away, I find a TV remote on the cushion.
Kohaku-san may have been watching TV earlier.
<Page21>
"Okay, thank you for your patience, Shiki-san.
Here's some tea for you."
"Ah, thanks but please don't mind me."
<Page22>
"No, no, I'm afraid I can't be as hospitable as I'd like to be."
With a friendly smile on her face, Kohaku-san serves me a cup of strong green tea and some sweet bean jelly as a snack.
<Page23>
"You came to watch TV, right?
What do you usually watch at this time?"
"Nothing specific, but mostly the news...maybe?"
<Page24>
"Is that so?
I thought you would be reading after dinner since you seem so laid-back."//落ち着いていますから better word maybe needed
<Page25>
"Unfortunately, I don't have such praise-worthy intentions.//殊勝な心がけ better word needed, this entire page probably needs a retranslation/rephrasing
I'm often seen as a diligent student, but I'm lazy at heart.
I guess it's the glasses that make me look so earnest."
<Page26>
"―――Ah, that's right!
Fufu, so about those glasses that you wear, Shiki-san.
Actually, I was surprised when I greeted you yesterday."
"Why is that?"
<Page27>
"Because Akiha-sama never told me that you wear glasses.
I was prepared for a man with cool and sharp eyes, just like her."
<Page28>
'My worries were unnecessary though', adds Kohaku-san, smiling.
...I see.
I've never met Akiha in person since I started wearing these glasses.
<Page29>
"But these glasses are just for show.
I can say that my eyes have a problem, but my eyesight is better than average. It didn't go bad from studying too much either. Aah...you had an intellectual image of me in mind, did I disappoint you?"//needs a recheck
<Page30>
"No, not at all.
I also enjoy watching TV more than reading books.
I'm glad that you are as energetic as I thought you would be."
<Page31>
"I-I see. Well, thanks."
Feeling embarrassed, I look away.
Kohaku-san's earnest smile right in front of me made me all flustered.
<Page32>
"Ah, I'm sorry.
You came to watch the news, and here I am chatting with you."
Kohaku-san turns on the TV.
<Page33>
Images appear on the screen.
It is a little past 9:30.
The news program is no longer a cheerful one for the general audience; it has shifted tone, and is now reporting on serious matters affecting society.
<Page34>
"Oh, dear. Another serial killing?"
The news is running a special report on a series of murders. // Literally 'random attacker murders', or 'slasher murders'. Not sure of a great EN TL here, 'serial killings' sorta works but want to avoid doubling up on 'serial' in this sentence / next sentence
The serial killings that started in the neighboring district are now being replicated here near Souya Station.
<Page35>
The story is simple.
'They indiscriminately abduct young women who are out late at night, kill them, and finally drain their blood.'
The number of victims has already reached eight, and the police's ability to keep up with the investigation has been called into question.
<Page36>
No further details have been reported by the media.
When it comes to the common characteristics of the victims, the precise cause of death or any other information, the news has obscured all details and reported only that 'their blood had been drained'.
I guess this is a way of restricting information in order to prevent copycat acts by amused criminals.
<Page37>
"It's a scary story. I wonder what the police are doing."
"Hmmm...the crime was so sudden that they couldn't pinpoint a motive? If it's a thrill killing in the middle of the night, it would be impossible to track him down as long as he wasn't caught in the act. Motive...you can't find a criminal without a motive."
<Page38>
"It's just bad luck for the people who were attacked... or maybe it was good luck for the killer since there were no eyewitnesses."
"Yes, well. If he weren't, it would be strange that the murderer hasn't been identified for almost two weeks now."
<Page39>
"I don't know. If they were well-prepared, it wouldn't sound so crazy anymore, would it?
I can only make conjectures, but the more murders you commit, the more evidence you leave behind."
<Page40>
"If there were eight missing people, there wouldn't be enough evidence, but since all eight bodies have been found, there should be enough circumstantial evidence.
There has to be a reason why the culprit still has not been caught."
<Page41>
"――――――"
...That is unexpected.
Although it is inappropriate, I am impressed.
Whether or not Kohaku-san's speculation is correct, I didn't expect her to think so deeply about the details of the case.
<Page42>
"But that would make the killer a well-prepared murderer, not a spur-of-the-moment thrill killer.
...If they were pretending to be a thrill killer and were going about their business as planned, then the seemingly unrelated people who were killed might have had some sort of connection after all."
<Page43>
"Well, I don't know about that.
If there was such a connection, the police would have noticed it by the second victim or so.
After all, this is an incomprehensible case with a superhuman level of preparation in terms of concealment, but very little in terms of purpose."
<Page44>
...Kohaku-san talks about a disturbing topic with a smile.
Apparently, she doesn't really care about the incident.
<Page45>
"Kohaku-san, this is an incident that is happening in this very city.
Don't you think it's a little scary, especially for a young girl like you?"
<Page46>
"Oh no, it's okay.
After all, serial killers only appear in the middle of the night. If I don't go out at night, I won't meet them."
<Page47>
Her way of thinking is very clear.
It's too graphic of a topic to be easily discussed, but maybe that's just the way it is with incidents we learn about on the news.
<Page48>
"I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
If I want to watch some more, I'll come back here so I'll be counting on you again."
<Page49>
"Yes, I'll be waiting for you."
Kohaku-san looks around the hallway.
<Page50>
"As much as I would like to see you back to your room, Hisui-chan is waiting for you there, so this is where we must part ways."
"Okay. Good night then."
<Page51>
"......"
...I didn't know that the bedtime at the mansion was ten o'clock.
In addition to the eight o'clock curfew, there is an unspoken rule in this mansion that you are not allowed to leave your room after ten o'clock.
<Page52>
"Seriously. It's so strict around here even without the old man around."
...Well, that's not surprising.
No matter how much technology advances or trends change, the Tohno family has maintained this way of life for hundreds of years.
Nothing will change just because Akiha became the head of the family.
<Page53>
"......She's been rather good to me, hasn't she?
At the very least, she sent the relatives away to another place."
<Page54>
...I'm getting tired of the unfamiliar atmosphere of this mansion.
I think I'll go back to my room quietly tonight.
