...The back of my neck feels strangely hot. It's becoming swollen and numb.
I wonder if it's because of that. I feel like I've lost track of where I was going.
<Page2>
The night is covering the city like water that has leaked out.
The hustle and bustle is incomparable to that of the morning.
The headlights of cars passing by.
The crowds of people being thrown out of the station, or being sucked in.
The number of school uniforms has dwindled,
and people in clothes of all sorts of colors are strolling about.
<Page3>
"------"
I stand up from my seat on the bench.
It's about time to go.
I have no reason to go there at all, but I turn my feet and head downtown.
<Page4>
"------"
I take a side street off the main road.
Rather than a street, it is a blind spot between buildings.
<Page5>
There are no people here around me.
There is no noise.
There are no signs of life.
Just a rustling sound coming from deep within.
<Page6>
The lights of the vending machines are too bright.
Too many conveniences of civilization, incongruous to this place.
It is too dazzling, so I walk past it.
I turn my feet to the gloomier, more appropriate darkness of the night.
<Page7>
...into a narrower, more secluded darkness.
I put my hand on the rusty iron fence.
If I open it and go deep enough, I'll find---
<Page8>
"Hey, you there."
"---Eh?"
<Page9>
I stop in my tracks.
I wake up with a light spark of dizziness.
...I don't know what's going on.
Why did I come to this place?
Why did I try to go this far back...?
<Page10>
"I'm sorry. Do you have a hundred yen on you?"
When I turn around, I see a strange girl in front of the vending machine.
"I've been trying to buy some juice...but I'm stuck without any change." she says.
<Page11>
"........"
Perhaps because I felt guilty about trying to go deeper into the alleyway, I just go with the flow and hand over a hundred yen.
<Page12>
"Thanks. I appreciate it."
She inserts the hundred yen into the vending machine and presses the button.
The girl takes out the can that the machine dropped.
She frowns, looking disappointed.
<Page13>
"You must be rather carefree to be taking a walk at this time of night.
Isn't there someone at your house waiting for you?"
"Eh--- yeah...!"
<Page14>
I look at my phone.
The clock ruthlessly strikes 7:40--- oh no, there's only 20 minutes left until curfew!
<Page15>
I rush out of the alleyway in a hurry.
-----And then.
"Hold on a second."
The girl stops me again.
<Page16>
"What? I'm sorry, but I have to hurry---"
She throws the can of juice at me.
I catch it in a panic, but wasn't it the one she bought?
<Page17>
"Take it."
"Um...why?"
"None of them tasted good."
<Page18>
The girl says grumpily and strolls past me.
<Page19>
"No, no, this is not the time to be distracted...!"
I hurry up and start running too.
Breaking the curfew on the first day is bad as a brother, no, as a human being even. I have to get back to the mansion before the lightning of the head of the family strikes me...!
