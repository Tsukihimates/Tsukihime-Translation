The clock in the living room reads 7:30.
I can make it in half an hour, but will Akiha be able to make it?
I think it's quite a distance to Asagami Private Girl's Academy... hmm?
<Page2>
"...Shiki-san, Shiki-san... can you hear me? ...Yes, you... I'm talking to you, who's on your knees in despair, overwhelmed by the merciless treatment of Akiha-sama..."
"......"
<Page3>
I wonder what she's doing.
She is hiding behind the sofa, inviting me to come over.
<Page4>
"...I can hear you. What is it, Kohaku-san?"
"...Not exactly ...I am a vague existence, a servant and not a servant as well... so, I'm giving this back to you..."
<Page5>
Kohaku-san furtively takes out a phone from the sleeve of her kimono.//琥珀さんは着物の<袖|そで>から、こそっと携帯電話を取りだした。
It's my phone that Akiha confiscated last night...!
<Page6>
"A-Are you sure?"
"Yes. But keep it a secret from Akiha-sama. Please be careful not to get caught.
Also, please refrain from using it in the mansion. The signal is not very good, so even if you wanted to use it, I don't think you could."
<Page7>
"Kohaku-san..."
Maybe there is some goodwill in this mansion after all.
I take the phone and quickly tuck it into the inner pocket of my uniform.
<Page8>
"And here you go. This is the authentication card for the main gate.
If you press the buzzer, I will unlock the gate, but it will take me some time to get to the security office.
I know it's a hassle, but if you're in a hurry, you can unlock the main gate with this."
<Page9>
An authentication card key for the main gate... as expected of the Tohno residence, the security is excellent.
<Page10>
"Well then, I'll go see Akiha-sama off.
I'll leave the rest to you, Hisui-chan."
"Yes. Have a good day, Nee-san."
Kohaku-san leaves, following after Akiha.
<Page11>
"Will you have enough time, Shiki-sama?"
"Yeah, it's only half an hour's walk from here to the school.
It's half-past seven now, so if I run a little on the way I can make it. But thanks for asking, Hisui."
Satisfied with my explanation, Hisui nods.
<Page12>
"Now then, I will escort you out."
"Eh―――Ah, yeah, thanks."
<Page13>
...As I thought, I'm still embarrassed to have my own servant.
Hisui urges me to get up from the sofa.
Although there was an unexpected visitor, my first morning here in seven years passed without problems.
<Page14>
Hisui sees me off as I leave the grounds of the mansion.
The Tohno residence is located on the edge of the city, on a hill away from the station.
On the hill, there is a forest that is rather out of place in an urban area. Depending on how you look at it, the Tohno residence could be seen as a gate built at the entrance to that forest.
<Page15>
From here to the school is a little over a 30-minute walk that crosses over the station.
If I hurry, I can make it in time for the morning homeroom.
<Page16>
I walk down the long slope.
I always took the train from the Arima house to Souya station, so it's my first time going to school by this route.
I feel like a new student, even though only my route has changed.
<Page17>
"――――There aren't many students from my school."
It seems that only a few people from these houses attend Souya High School.
It's 7:30 in the morning.
I'm the only person here in a school uniform running down the street.
<Page18>
Unlike the south gate of the station yesterday, the north gate is crowded with commuters.
It is the usual scene of office workers in suits walking past at a fast pace.
<Page19>
The disturbing news of recent events seems to have had no effect on them.
Or even if they are feeling unsettled, that isn't enough of a reason to change their daily schedule. //Note: There isn't a ton of rhyme or reason to when I change these to contractions, generally just whenever there's a lot of text and the narration is starting to feel a little robotic.
<Page20>
Either way, there is no change in the city.
Arihiko said that he avoids going out at night, but I guess not everyone can trust their instincts and follow them as he does.
<Page21>
I head to the residential area from the station.
The only people I see on the street are students in school uniforms.
I look at my mobile phone and see that I have five minutes left before the school gates close.
I run on the asphalt road, careful not be late.
<Page22>
As I told Hisui, it took me about 30 minutes from the mansion to reach the main gate.
I ran a couple of times along the way, so if I want to take my time getting to school, I should leave the mansion before 7:30.
