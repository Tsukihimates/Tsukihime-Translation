"I-I'm home..."
I open and close the front door as quietly as I can and discreetly enter the lobby, announcing my return in a voice that was neither too loud nor too quiet.
<Page2>
The time was 8:00 pm, one minute ago.
I ran as fast as I could from the front of the station and just barely made it in time, but honestly, it was so hard that I felt like throwing up. That slope is too much of a pain in the ass.
It was fine because it was downhill on the way to school, but I forgot that it will be uphill on the way back to the mansion.
<Page3>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama.
I know you are tired, but before you go back to your room, please come to the office. ---Akiha-sama has something to tell you."
<Page4>
"Ugh...the office, is it?"
The fact that Akiha took the trouble to call me into her office shows that she's in a bad mood.
<Page5>
"You are taking a detour because you have money to spare.
As punishment, I will reduce your monthly allowance by about 20%."
<Page6>
And that was the punishment.
As soon as I entered the office, I was told of the decision without any room for explanation.
I mean, yeah...from now on, I'll be getting my monthly allowance from Akiha...and suddenly it's reduced...
Rejoice, Father. Akiha grew up to be a much stricter master than you.
<Page7>
"B-but that's not true, is it? I came back before curfew, remember?
...Well, I didn't make it before dark, but..."
<Page8>
"Oh, that is surprising. You were aware that you made a promise to me. In that case, why did you not keep it?"
"No. It's just, I forgot."
<Page9>
"Nii-san, I forgot to tell you something as well.
As an added punishment, you will not have dinner tonight."
"Wha...."
<Page10>
What a tyrant...!
Even with me being on time. this strictness is seriously frightening...if I had broken the curfew, what would've happened to me?
<Page11>
...I trudge across the lobby and head to my room.
After that, I protested to the head of the family, but could not undo the punishment of taking away my dinner.
On the other hand, my allowance was only cut by 10%.
It was a major victory in terms of a brother's dignity.
<Page12>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san."
"...Kohaku-san?"
I was on my way back to my room when Kohaku comes to talk to me.
Just like this morning, she hides herself in a corner of the corridor and talks in private.
<Page13>
"Come on. That's no good, you should have come home on time today at least.
No matter how you look at it, this is all because you came back at such a slow pace after saying that you would keep your promise for a day at least."
"? Wait, who told you that?"
<Page14>
"Well obviously that's...#n-no, it's none of your concern.
Ahem. In any case, as a servant, I cannot overlook the fact that you did not have dinner.
As a result, I prepared a light meal for you in your room.
Although it's just a rice ball and miso soup."
<Page15>
"......!"
What a thoughtful maid she is...!
I'm sure she'll be scolded if Akiha finds out about the phone in the morning, but to think that she would go this far...
<Page16>
"But is this really okay? It'd be a huge help but..."
"Of course. This is about your health after all.
Besides, Hisui-chan has also agreed to this. Even if Akiha-sama finds out, I'm sure she'll forgive us if we both apologize."
"I see, that girl also..."
<Page17>
She was looking out for me.
It's easy to misunderstand her because she doesn't seem to show her emotions, but it seems that Hisui also felt bad about my "no dinner" treatment.
<Page18>
"Shiki-san. Her name's not 'that girl'. It's Hisui-chan."
"Oh, yeah, I know. But since I don't know her well yet, I feel bad about calling her by her name so casually."
<Page19>
"No, you shouldn't do that. That's too cruel.
Hisui-chan is very kind in spite of her appearance.
So please, don't be reserved and call her by her first name as if she were family."
<Page20>
Kohaku-san is staring straight at me.
...She's right. It would be difficult for her if I continue to act like a stranger.
I'm sure she's just as concerned about me as Kohaku right now, so I should be more open with her if possible.
<Page21>
"I understand. From now on, no matter what happens, I'll call her Hisui-cha...no, saying "chan" is a bit too embarrassing so I'll just call her Hisui."
"Yes, that would be much appreciated."
<Page22>
After that, Kohaku-san goes downstairs.
In this time of distress, I pray within my heart to the Nightingale of the Tohno residence and return to my room.
Rice balls, huh...they must be very tasty since they were made by Kohaku-san....
<Page23>
"---Phew, that was a nice bath."
I ate the rice balls specially made by Kohaku-san,
got told it by Hisui that it was bath time,
and when I came back from the bath, it was nine o'clock in the evening.
<Page24>
It's a little too early to go to sleep.
I have nothing at hand to read other than a textbook.
I'm not even that tired today.
Rather than wasting time, I decide to go to---
C:>Akiha in the living room.
C:>Kohaku-san's room.
C:>Rest here.
