Awoooooooooooooo--------
---Like a wave, I hear the sound of something.
<Page2>
Awooooooooooo-----------
---The howl of an animal. It's fine and shrill like of a wild dog.
<Page3>
Awooooooooooo-----------
---It rings in my eardrums. Is it howling at the moon?
<Page4>
Awooooooooooo-----------
---An unpleasant sensation. The roar of this beast gives me a headache.
<Page5>
Awooooooooooo----------
---The sound does not stop.
Like a bullet shot into my skull.
It echoes stronger.
<Page6>
Awooooooooooo.
Awooooooooooo.
Awooooooooooo----
<Page7>
"...Oh my god, it's so loud!"
I open my eyes, putting on my glasses.
I can still hear the dog howling outside my window.
<Page8>
The clock has just turned eleven at night.
It's more than just disturbing my sleep.
<Page9>
"Damn...what the hell is with that noise...?"
The dog's howl reaches all the way to my ears from outside the mansion. // Slightly non-literal TL, but avoids the confusion of "howl can be heard from outside the mansion", which suggests that the noise is coming from _inside_ and the hearing is being done _outside_
...I'm not going to be able to sleep at this rate.
<Page10>
"...I guess there's no choice.
I can't call the police to tell them that some dog is being too noisy."
<Page11>
I get out of bed and change back into my school uniform.
I'm sure that Akiha and the others are having trouble sleeping as well.
I'm the only man in the mansion, so I guess I have to take care of it for them.
<Page12>
I leave the mansion.
Nothing moves, as though the night has frozen over.
<Page13>
The moon is hidden behind the clouds.
Even the light from the streetlamps appears to have congealed like paint drops on a canvas.
<Page14>
Awoooooooooo.
............Awooooooo.............
........................awoooo..............
<Page15>
Oddly enough, the howling sounds weaker out here.
Or is the howl just starting to fade?
Either way, it doesn't matter much.
The noise is more painful to my mind and eyes than to my ears.
Just listening to it makes my heart pound so fast that I start to feel sick.
<Page16>
"Shut up."
My legs feel heavy as I start walking.
I start to lose feeling in my fingertips. // Lit: the feeling in my fingertips is unreliable, uncertain
Suddenly.
I notice that my breath is white.
<Page17>
It's even quieter outside the mansion.
It feels as if everything has ceased to exist.
In this frozen world, my shadow is the only thing that moves. // Ruby text is 'のびる', but stretch/extend reads a bit oddly here.
<Page18>
"........."
I don't know why I'm so thirsty.
Around the mansion, high walls stretch out endlessly into the night.
Warming my numb fingers with my breath, I walk in the direction where the dogs are probably gathered.
<Page19>
"------Eh?"
My thoughts come to a halt.
In the distance, under a light, I see something.
I've never seen anything like it before (not in the real world).
An impossible sight---
<Page20>
                                    A melting dog.
What is that?!
                       A long blade pointed at it.
What is that?!
                                    A melted howl.
What is that?!
                        A long blade that pierces.
What is that?!
<Page21>
A scream as if it had lost its mind.
Or like a gale.
After the sounds that tore at my eardrums passed through, there were no more cries or even signs of the dog remaining.
As if it had never existed in the first place.
It fades away without a trace.
<Page22>
---So, it's an illusion.
Is what I'm seeing now a hallucination or a dream?
<Page23>
---Then, is that an illusion too?
There, under the streetlight that slices through the darkness, stands an obscure figure.
<Page24>
Is that a coat? ...I wonder.
The figure wearing a thick coat doesn't seem to notice me as I stand stock still.
<Page25>
"------"
I'm thirsty. My whole body is sweating.
The night air sticks to my skin.
It's not like anything is wrong with me.
But everything feels heavy like I'm at the bottom of the ocean.
<Page26>
[zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00][zap00]
I hear a distant, foreign sound.
The dizziness almost knocks me unconscious.
I put all my strength into my staggering legs and manage to stay on my feet without falling.
And then---
What I see before me is the usual, quiet road.
<Page27>
"Ha----h."
I breathe a sigh of relief, and my lungs greedily take in air.
...I didn't realize it, but I haven't been breathing properly since I left the main gate.
<Page28>
"........."
I don't hear them howling anymore.
...As if overcome by fever, I leave the illusion.
<Page29>
...I'm back in my room.
There is no sign that Akiha and the others are awake.
It seems that I was the only one who could not stand that dog's howling.
<Page30>
"-----Guh."
I wonder what that was.
My head still hurts.
<Page31>
"Huh? I wonder why I'm shaking."
My fingers are trembling.
My whole body is shaking, and my back is very cold.
Metaphorically speaking,
it's like someone ripped out my spinal cord and put a pillar of ice in its place.
<Page32>
"-----"
I feel dizzy and lightheaded.
I wonder if it's the usual anemia.
I feel like my consciousness is being thrown to the ground with my brain and all.
On the way, I see something I don't like.
<Page33>
"------"
Even though I'm wearing my glasses, I can still see those "lines".
<Page34>
"Ugh.....!"
My eyeballs can't take the nausea that's been building up.
It's a reaction to the fact that I've been trying not to see them for the last seven years.
<Page35>
My mind can't bear this scene.
I feel sick. Combined with the dizziness from the anemia, I feel like I'm about to throw up the contents of my stomach at any moment.
<Page36>
"I can't believe it. What's going on here?"
I really don't know.
But as long as I keep my eyes open, I can't help but see the lines.
<Page37>
"---It's a bad dream."
I manage to fall into the bed.
...Yeah, in that case, I should just go to sleep. It's the quickest way to deny what I've seen.
<Page38>
...I can't even move my body like I want to.
For now, I'm just going to stay like this, like a corpse.
I just need to go to sleep, like a puppet with broken strings---
