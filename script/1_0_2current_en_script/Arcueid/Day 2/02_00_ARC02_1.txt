<Page1>
At some point, you understood that this wasn't a dream.
<Page2>
The things that you see in this moment,
are actually the repetition of a past that really occurred. //Having "actually" and "really" in the same line seems redundant
Perhaps it's a form of introspection and self-reproach.
A refrain of both present and future that borrowed the form of a lucid dream.
<Page3>
You do not dream.
I'm not here even now.
Tohno Shiki does not know dreams.
I don't know you even now.
<Page4>
And that's why this story must now come to an end.
Undeterred and unexisting, you are dreaming of a story that has already passed.//おしまいの話を、懲りずあらずに夢見ている。That 懲りずあらず is bit confusing to me.　あらず isn't much used, except in some set expressions dating back from classical Japanese.  After thinking about it, my best guess is that it can't modify 懲りず, and should be taken as separate, like 懲りず（に）、あらずに. So "you" (because I'm pretty sure it's "you" and not "I") are [dreaming] undeterred (懲りず) and [dreaming while] not existing. Does that make sense? I don't know, that's a confusing sequence. A story that has already passed/that has concluded/that has come to an end

<Like the snow that falls|T h e  s t a r s   t w i n k l e          >.  //Thoughts on changing these lines to "the stars that twinkle" and "the sea that crashes" to match the main text?
<Like the waves that come and go|T h e   s e a   c r a s h e s               >.
<Like the waning moon|L i k e   s e e k i n g   y o u r   s h a d o w          >.
Refrain, refrain, refrain, refrain...

"Good morning."
I hear an unfamiliar voice.
My deeply sunken consciousness awakens.
<Page7>
"It is morning. It is time to wake up, Shiki-sama."
...Like I said, please don't call me Shiki-sama.
I told you yesterday that I feel uncomfortable when you say that―――
<Page8>
"――――――nnnh."
After opening my eyes, I pick up the glasses on the bedside table and put them on.
Immediately, the anomaly fades away.
To try and shake off my sluggishness, I lift myself out of bed.
<Page9>
"......"
Where am I?
<Page10>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
The girl in the maid uniform bows. //The possessive form seems unnecessary
"...Ah, I see. I've returned to the Tohno mansion, right?"
<Page11>
"Yes. I know you were tired yesterday."
I've only just woken up, and Hisui is standing upright in front of the doorway, looking at me. She looks like a well-made statue.
<Page12>
"......"
Perhaps it's because I slept in an unfamiliar room, but my consciousness is hazy as if shrouded in fog. //I think fog/foggy would be the English term for this, i.e. foggy mind
"Shiki-sama...?"
Hisui calls out to me.
I shake my head vigorously to wake myself up.
<Page13>
"Morning, Hisui. Thanks for taking the time to wake me up."
"Such words are unnecessary.
It is my duty to wake you up, after all."
<Page14>
...Hisui replies nonchalantly.
I feel a faint sense of unease, or that I am somehow unworthy of this gesture. //Using "sense of" twice is repetitive
If she were half as cheerful as Kohaku-san, she'd be a force to be reckoned with, wouldn't she?
I wouldn't know, though. It's not my place to say anything about her personality.
<Page15>
"Is there anything I can help you with?"
As if she noticed my gaze, Hisui looks straight back at me.
<Page16>
"No, it's nothing.
It's just that seeing your face made me realize that this is the Tohno residence."
<Page17>
I get up from the bed and take a breath.
It's just before seven in the morning.
I woke up a little earlier than usual.
<Page18>
"I'll go downstairs after I change my clothes.
Should I go to the living room... or not, maybe the dining room instead?"
<Page19>
"Yes, please come to the dining room. Breakfast is ready."
"All right. Thanks."
Hisui bows and leaves the room.
<Page20>
I go down to the first-floor lobby.
I've changed my shirt and underwear and put on my standard school uniform.
The dining room is the entryway to the west wing... If you stand in the lobby, the dining room is the large room to your left; directly opposite it across the stairs is the living room in the east wing.
<Page21>
"Good morning, Shiki-san.
I will have breakfast ready for you right away."
<Page22>
Kohaku-san is waiting for me in the dining room.
The reason why she called me 'Shiki-san' was probably because Hisui had told her to last night.
Hisui is adamant about using '-sama', but Kohaku-san seems to be flexible about it.
It really shows the difference between their personalities. //This sentence and the whole paragraph sound a little... clinical? Like a textbook or something, it feels off.
<Page23>
Kohaku-san serves the food quickly and efficiently.
It is a pure, captivating Japanese-style breakfast, following the 'one soup, three dishes' rule.
However―――
<Page24>
"...Oh no. I should have told you yesterday."
"Oh, is there something in there you do not like?
Shiki-san, do you not like turnips?"
"No, I'm proud to say that I'm not a picky eater, but how should I say this..."
<Page25>
It is a bit too much.
I'm a light eater to start with and eat even less in the morning.
When I eat neatly arranged food, I start to get heartburn and lose my appetite.
I'm feeling good this morning, so I think I can eat half of it, but when I'm not feeling well, my chopsticks sometimes stop after one bite.
<Page26>
"Is that so? ...I've heard that you're a light eater, so I tried to go easy on you with this one, but... it won't do?"
"I'm sorry. It's just the after-effects of an accident, and there's not much I can do about it... Ah, b-but I can tell it looks really good! This breakfast is absolutely perfect!" //Missing the stutter in the JP text and voiceover
<Page27>
I do my best to express my honest opinion.
Kohaku-san is not at fault at all, and I can't let my selfishness ruin the meal she prepared.
<Page28>
"Anyway, thanks for the food.
I'm sorry if I leave anything on the plate."
<Page29>
"No, don't worry about it. I'm a pro in this field too. I'll make sure you get the right amount. //Thoughts on using "pro" since she actually says it?
Then, please eat. If it doesn't suit your taste buds, please don't hesitate to let me know."
<Page30>
"Thank you for the food. It was very good."
I put my hands together and thank her.
<Page31>
Kohaku-san's breakfast was perfect in both appearance and taste.
It was lightly and elegantly seasoned but had enough of a kick to it to stimulate my appetite.
An average high school boy would have ordered a second helping without hesitation.
<Page32>
"I'm sorry that I left some of the food you prepared for me, though."
<Page33>
"It's okay, it's my fault for not asking about it first.
Besides, I'm already quite pleased. Shiki-san, you looked really happy when you ate it. It's worth all the hard work I've put in for this day."
<Page34>
Kohaku-san smiles at me.
I feel like smiling too.
I think I'm the one who should be happy to see such a face.
<Page35>
"...Oh no, it's already this late.
Don't mind me and please go to the living room. I'll prepare some after breakfast tea. If I monopolize you too much, I'm afraid of what might happen later."
<Page36>
Chuckling, Kohaku-san puts away the leftovers.
It's 7:20. I should be getting ready for school.
I thank her once again for the meal and leave the dining room.
