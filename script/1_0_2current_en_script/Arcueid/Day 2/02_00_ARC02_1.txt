At some point, you understood that this wasn't a dream.
<Page2>
The things that you see in this moment,
are actually the repetition of a past that really occurred.
Perhaps it's a form of introspection and self-reproach.
A refrain of both present and future that borrowed the form of a lucid dream.
<Page3>
You do not dream.
I'm not here even now.
Tohno Shiki does not know dreams.
I don't know you even now.
<Page4>
And that's why this story must now come to an end.
I still have dreams about the end, without fail.

Refrain, refrain, refrain, refrain...

"Good morning."
I hear an unfamiliar voice.
My deeply sunken consciousness awakens.
<Page7>
"It is morning. It is time to wake up, Shiki-sama."
...Like I said please don't call me Shiki-sama.
I told you yesterday that I feel uncomfortable when you say that―――
<Page8>
"――――――nnnh."
Upon opening my eyes, I pick up the glasses on the bedside table and put them on.
Immediately, the anomaly fades away.
To try and shake off my sluggishness, I lift myself out of bed.
<Page9>
"......"
Where am I?
<Page10>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
The girl in the maid's uniform bows.
"...Ah, I see. I've returned to the Tohno mansion, right?"
<Page11>
"Yes. I know you were tired yesterday."
I've only just woken up, and Hisui is standing upright in front of the doorway, looking at me. She looks like a well-made statue.
<Page12>
"....."
Perhaps it's because I slept in an unfamiliar room, but my consciousness is hazy as if in a mist.
"Shiki-sama...?"
Hisui calls out to me.
I shake my head vigorously to wake myself up.
<Page13>
"Morning, Hisui. Thanks for taking the time to wake me up."
"Such words are unnecessary.
It is my duty to wake you up after all."
<Page14>
...Hisui replies nonchalantly.
I feel a faint sense of unease or a sense of being unworthy of this gesture.
If she were half as cheerful as Kohaku-san, she'd be a force to be reckoned with, wouldn't she?
I wouldn't know though, it's not my place to say anything about her personality.
<Page15>
"Is there anything I can help you with?"
As if she noticed my gaze, Hisui looks straight back at me.
<Page16>
"No, it's nothing.
It's just that seeing your face made me realize that this is the Tohno residence."
<Page17>
I get up from the bed and take a breath.
It's just before seven in the morning.
I woke up a little earlier than usual.
<Page18>
"I'll go downstairs after I change my clothes.
Should I go to the living room...or not, maybe the dining room instead?"
<Page19>
"Yes, please come to the dining room. Breakfast is ready."
"All right. Thanks."
Hisui bows and leaves the room.
<Page20>
I go down to the first-floor lobby.
I've changed my shirt and underwear and put on my standard school uniform.
The dining room is the entryway to the west wing...if you stand in the lobby, the dining room is the large room to your left; directly opposite it across the stairs is the living room in the east wing.
<Page21>
"Good morning, Shiki-san.
I will have breakfast ready for you right away."
<Page22>
Kohaku-san is waiting for me in the dining room.
The reason why she called me 'Shiki-san' was probably because Hisui had told her to last night.
Hisui is adamant about using '-sama', but Kohaku-san seems to be flexible about it.
This also shows the difference in their personalities.
<Page23>
Kohaku-san serves the food quickly and efficiently.
It is a pure, captivating Japanese-style breakfast, following the 'one soup, three dishes' rule.
However―――
<Page24>
"...Oh no. I should have told you yesterday."
"Oh, is there something in there you don't like?
Shiki-san, do you not like turnips?"
"No, I'm proud to say that I'm not a picky eater, but how should I say this..."
<Page25>
It is a bit too much.
I'm a light eater to start with and eat even less in the morning.
When I eat neatly arranged food, I start to get heartburn and lose my appetite.
I'm feeling good this morning, so I think I can eat half of it, but when I'm not feeling well, my chopsticks sometimes stop after one bite.
<Page26>
"Is that so? ...I've heard that you're a light eater, so I tried to go easy on you with this one, but...it won't do?"
"I'm sorry. It's just the after-effects of an accident, and there's not much I can do about it...ah, but I can tell it looks really good! This breakfast is absolutely perfect!"
<Page27>
I do my best to express my honest opinion.
Kohaku-san is not at fault at all, and I can't let my selfishness ruin the meal she prepared.
<Page28>
"Anyway, thanks for the food.
I'm sorry if I leave anything on the plate."
<Page29>
"No, don't worry about it. I'm an expert in this field too. I'll make sure you get the right amount.
Then, please eat. If it doesn't suit your taste buds, please don't hesitate to let me know."
<Page30>
"Thank you for the food. It was very good."
I put my hands together and thank her.
<Page31>
Kohaku-san's breakfast was perfect in both appearance and taste.
It was lightly and elegantly seasoned but had enough of a kick to it to stimulate my appetite.
An average high school boy would have ordered a second helping without hesitation.
<Page32>
"But I'm sorry that I left some of the food you prepared for me."
<Page33>
"It's okay, it's my fault for not asking about it first.
Besides, I'm happy enough. Shiki-san, you really looked so happy when you ate it. It's worth all the hard work I've put in for this day."
<Page34>
Kohaku-san smiles at me.
I feel like smiling too.
I think I'm the one who should be happy to see such a face.
<Page35>
"...Oh no, it's already this late.
Don't mind me and please go to the living room. I'll prepare some after breakfast tea. If I monopolize you too much, I'm afraid of what might happen later."
<Page36>
Chuckling, Kohaku-san puts away the leftovers.
It's 7:20. I should be getting ready for school.
I thank her once again for the meal and leave the dining room.
