It's not that I don't want to go home... but I need some more time before I get used to that luxurious mansion.
Maybe I'll visit Arihiko's house, or stop by the bookstore in the station building.
Whatever I end up doing, if I only detour for an hour, I should be able to make it to the mansion before the curfew.
