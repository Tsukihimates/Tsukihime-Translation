There is no sign of Arihiko in the classroom. It seems that he really came to school early yesterday on a whim.
I go to my desk, greeting my familiar classmates.
<Page2>
For a few minutes before homeroom, I sit on my chair and check my phone.
The morning's public news. The school bulletin board, created by a group of young teachers, and the anonymous student bulletin board, created by a group of volunteers.
There are no threads that catch my attention.
I look up and see that most of the students in the classroom are spending their time the same way.
<Page3>
The teachers who are over thirty say that today's students seem to have no friends in real life.
Of course, that's an outdated misconception and one that seems unique to people from the previous generation.
Dependence on the internet and dependence on friends in front of you have become equivalent, and no one in our class is at odds over that.
<Page4>
School used to be a place where you could only make friends inside the classroom. There was little connection to the outside world.
It's different now. You can find as many friends as you want. The atmosphere in the classroom doesn't have to be homey. As long as it's not unpleasant, then it's fine.

Thanks to the highly developed internet, the gap in the amount of knowledge we have based on age has become insignificant.
Although there is a difference in the number of things we have accumulated, we seem to have evened out in terms of lifestyles.
<Page6>
Adults say that there is no enthusiasm, no dreams, and no hope in us, but that's just the way it is.
It's a small world now. Even elementary school students know how stagnant our society has become.
So it's getting harder and harder to dream about the future, to accept the world through one's own filter.
<Page7>
That's what sharing knowledge is all about.
The more the library of knowledge expands, the smaller and smaller will be the lives of the individuals who browse it.
<Page8>
In the past, humans aimed beyond to fill in the unknown.
Now, there is no need to do so. There is no need to go anywhere.
People are as free as they can be, but they also have no reason to step out of their narrow boxes.
I think that's what the depressing sense of stagnation in classrooms, schools, and cities is all about.
<Page9>
And so on. Although I have tried to analyze this in a pretentious manner, these are just my own impressions.
I do not feel a sense of stagnation.
It's not as if I have a sense of standstill, weariness, or resentment towards society.
<Page10>
All I have is the obvious desire to enjoy every day as much as possible.
It would be a mistake for such a simple-minded person to talk about the complications of society.
<Page11>
While I'm pondering, the homeroom bell rings.
The students who were milling around chatting return to their seats.
I put away my phone and switch my attitude.
It's the second day back at the Tohno residence, and school is about to start.
