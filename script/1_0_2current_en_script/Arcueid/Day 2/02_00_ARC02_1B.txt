In the living room, I see Akiha and Hisui.
Akiha's uniform is from a famous school for young ladies called Asagami Private Girl's Academy.
<Page2>
"Y-Yo. Morning, Akiha."
"Good morning, Nii-san.
It seems that you woke up late this morning... Well, that is fine. I will just attribute it to you not sleeping well on your first day and leave it at that." //"Say" makes it sound like she's going to tell someone else, I think "assume" is closer to the actual intent.
<Page3>
"......"
The word 'blunt' comes to mind.
I swallow the words 'I was actually up earlier than usual' and sit down on the sofa. //This should either lose "that" or use a word other than "words", like "comment" or "thought".
<Page4>
"Hisui, please bring a cup of tea for Nii-san.
I will have another cup as well."
"Understood. Shiki-sama, would you like sugar in your tea?"
"Ah, yes. Just one spoon, though."
<Page5>
And so, the awkward morning hour begins. //Isn't he leaving for school in less than an hour? Also, tense on "began".
"........."
"........."
Hisui puts the teacup on the table, then goes back to waiting by the wall.
I silently take a sip of the dark red tea and―――# wait, what's this taste...?
<Page6>
"It's so delicious...
It's bitter yet sweet, complex yet cleansing on the throat, and it smells just like Christmas...!"
<Page7>
I don't know what I'm saying, but that's just how shocked I am.
I learned last night of the grandeur of the Tohno residence, and this tea is no exception.
<Page8>
"This morning we are having Esprit de Noel from Mariage.
The most famous tea stores are in England, but this is from France. It was founded around 1850 and only recently landed in Japan about 15 years ago... It is not a major brand, but the quality is good." //New sentence after ellipsis?
<Page9>
"Fufu...the expression 'Christmas' is so vague I can hardly approve of it, but strangely enough, it conveys the nuance."//「ふふ……クリスマスという表現は曖昧すぎて評価しづらいですけど、不思議とニュアンスは伝わりますね」
I'm not sure if my expression was too funny, but Akiha is smiling with pride.
<Page10>
"I hear the price is fair, and it was well worth making my commoner brother taste it. Do you see now that a fine leaf is worth its weight in gold?"//「お値段もお手頃だそうですし、庶民派な兄さんに合わせてみた甲斐がありました。上質の葉には黄金に等しい価値があると勉強になりましたか？」
<Page11>
Her condescending attitude is that of a ruler looking down on a pathetic, primitive man. //Does "is" or "was" fit better here?
Even her gesture when placing the teacup on the saucer is elegant.
<Page12>
"Tch..."
But, unfortunately, she's right.
This tea is the real deal... What was the tea I've been drinking in the afternoon until now? I mean, you could certainly start a business or two with this. If such a thing existed in a time period where entertainment was scarce, even I would desperately try to get my hands on it.//これが本当の紅茶……今まで俺が午後に飲んでいた紅茶とはなんだったのか……というか、これなら貿易会社の一つや二つ、確かに起こる。娯楽の少ない時代にこんなものがあったら、俺だって必死に取り寄せたくなるぞ……。
<Page13>
About 10 minutes pass by.
"........."
Both Akiha and I just enjoy the tea without any conversation. //What tense for "enjoy" is best?
This was the result of us occasionally exchanging glances, but then returning our gaze to our teacups without anything to discuss over and over again.
To be honest, it was awkward at best. //Three clauses reads awkwardly with such a short sentence.
<Page14>
Still, it wasn't a bad experience for me.
It's not something I can say as I had been left to my own devices until just recently, but just seeing Akiha spending her time like this in peace gives me an indescribable feeling.
Is that... relief I feel? Whatever it is, I can't help but be happy that Akiha is in front of me right now.//これは安心……なんだろうか。どうあれ秋葉が目の前にいてくれる事が、今は嬉しくて仕方がない。
<Page15>
While I was immersed in this small sense of satisfaction, I hear a strange sound coming from the hallway.
<Page16>
"Major remodel, major romance!
Chaos, violence, and finally, insanity.
Stampede into hell!!"
Through the wall, a humming with no tempo whatsoever approaches.
<Page17>
"Hiii, good mooorning!
And good morning to you, Matriarch-chaaaaan!"
<Page18>
Having dramatically opened the door, a woman with an appearance as outlandish as her arrival barges into the living room.
<Page19>
A leather jacket that stops one step short of covering her underwear, and a tight leather skirt.
Her unusually long hair is arranged without rhyme or reason.
She doesn't seem to have any makeup on, but her lips are strangely alluring.
Her hair is reddish blonde, which combined with her tall stature makes her seem like a foreigner.
<Page20>
As far as I can see from her exposed chest and waist, she has an excellent figure.
The woman who arrived is 'mature' in her own right and would be more at home lying on a beach in the middle of summer than in an anachronistic Western-style building like this.
...Well, if it weren't for the oddly fitting lab coat.
<Page21>
"...Good morning, Dr. Arach.
What can I do for you today? I thought the routine check-up was yesterday."
<Page22>
"Well, I wasn't in the mood for it yesterday.
When I was watching the sunset, I got frustrated, so I abandoned my research and ran out to the city. In short, I just skipped work. So, I came here in the morning to get some work done today!
Oh, Maid-chan, please give me some tea. Four or five spoonfuls of sugar, maybe six if you feel like it?"
<Page23>
The woman in a white coat strolls into the living room.
Naturally, her eyes meet mine as I sit there on the sofa.
<Page24>
"What? Whaaat? Whaaaaaat―――?
Oh? Hmmm? Mmmmmmmmm―――?"
<Page25>
She's staring at me intently.
As if she came to an understanding after thoroughly observing me,# the woman seemed to smile mischievously―――
<Page26>
"Hi―――hihi, uhihihihihihihihihihihihi!
T-This is too good to be true―――!
What's this, did our Matriarch-chan come up with a plan to kill me with laughter? That's amazing, like A10 fully secreted from a dead mast cell!
Oh, my God, it's like Macbeth in this house! You're all rushing headlong into a tragedy like it's already kill or be killed!"
<Page27>
The woman is laughing while grabbing her belly.
"........."
There was nothing I could do but frown.
What's with this high-spirited person? Akiha calls her doctor, but...
<Page28>
"Dr. Arach.
Could you make your introductions to Nii-san as well?"
As if she couldn't stand the sight of me being so lost, Akiha clears her throat and chides the woman in the white lab coat.
<Page29>
"Hmm? Are you talking about me? Or Shiki-chan?
It's okay, there's no point.
I've heard about him from Makihisa-kun.
He's not interested in the affairs of a stranger like me, right? Besides, if he really wanted to, wouldn't he be better off talking to Matriarch-chan?"//志貴チャンだって、アタシみたいな余所者の事情なんて興味ないでしょう？　つーかそんな甲斐性があるなら当主チャンに向けてあげろって話ぃ？」
<Page30>
Makihisa-kun...?
So, is this woman an acquaintance of the old man?
<Page31>
"Well, I've always been a vagabond, carefree woman, like a webless spider drifting in the wind,//「そうそう。アタシはもともと気ままな<根|デ><無|ラ><し|シ><草|ネ>、風に漂う巣なしのクモみたいなオンナだったんだけどぉ、The 根無し草・デラシネ part was left out. Change "rootless" to "déracinée" if the font allows it
but then fate brought me to Makihisa-kun.
'If you have nowhere else to go, why don't you come live with us?'
That's how cool he sounded when he said that!# But alas, he's not reaaaaaaally my type, so I simply turned him down, and so now I guess I'm friends with the current head?# Or something like that."
<Page32>
Searching for confirmation, I shoot a glance over at Akiha.
...It takes a lot of courage to talk to this woman.
<Page33>
"Yes. Dr. Arach was father's junior at the university.
As a friend of father, she is now acting as my advisor."
<Page34>
"Eeeh? I don't like it when you call me that.
Pro-fes-sor. I'll cry if you don't call me Professor Arach with love and affection!"
<Page35>
Instead of crying, Dr. Arach smiles and laughs.
...But.
She smiles, but her eyes are fixed on my face like a sticky thread, as they have been ever since she came into this room.
<Page36>
"Here you go, Arach-sama. Your tea is ready."
<Page37>
Hisui intervenes.
Without reading the atmosphere... no, without being affected by the atmosphere, Hisui neutralized the tension created by Arach.//場の空気を読まない……いや、場の空気に左右されない翡翠の態度が、阿良句女史のテンションを中和してくれたようだ。In this line and line 139, there's a 女史 suffix for Arach which is usually translated as Miss, Ms, Mrs. I think we can leave it as it is, just pointing it out in case we want to change it.
<Page38>
"Oh, Maid-chan. You really are the epitome of a maid."
...She's sulking because she was interrupted.
With one hand on her hip, she drinks the sugar-filled tea in one big, hearty gulp as if drinking a sports drink.//阿良句女史は片手を腰にあて、スポーツドリンクを飲むような豪快さで、砂糖のたっぷり入った紅茶を一息で飲みきった。
<Page39>
"Ohh, nice sugar! You're pervading all five of my senses! You're even making my uterus and my ovaries melt... I feel it coming! Haah... thanks for the meaaal!" //Thoughts on keeping "nice sugar" since she says it in 'English' here? I'm a little scared to mess with Arach's dialogue, though.
<Page40>
"Well then, I'm off for a routine check-up! There's something wrong with the air conditioning in the master bathroom, right? I know, I know. I'll just do a quick check and then add an air sterilizer or something while I'm at it!"
<Page41>
With a high-pitched laugh, Arach crosses the living room and heads to the hallway... however.
As she touches the doorknob, the woman turns to me and says,
<Page42>
"Nice to meet you, Shiki-chan. How about we get along as fellow outsiders?
A lot is going to happen from now on, but...
If you really can't bear it anymore, why don't you come talk to me? You'll have nothing to lose."//もう本当にどうしようもなくなったら、ダメ元でアタシに相談しにいらっしゃい？」
<Page43>
The unwanted guest walks away, humming the same tune as when she arrived.
"........."
"........."
An inexpressible silence envelops the living room.
<Page44>
"Hey, Akiha."
"I do not know much about Dr. Arach either.
But due to father's will, she is in charge of the maintenance and management of the main building. I heard that father highly valued her as an architect. According to Arach herself however, this seems to have been something she did on the side."//お父様の遺言の関係で、屋敷本館への出入りと手入れを一任されている方です。お父様は建築家として重宝なさっていたとか。ご本人曰く、建築業は副業だそうですが」Is "will" clear enough here for 遺言 "testament"?
<Page45>
Akiha assures me firmly.
She interrupts me before I can ask 'What's with that woman?'
She makes clear that she won't be answering any further questions.//“それ以上の質問は受け付けません”といわんばかりの態度だ。
<Page46>
"If you will excuse me. Akiha-sama, it is time for you to go to school...# Hmm? There seems to be a tense atmosphere in here.
Haha. Did you already frighten Shiki-san by saying something unreasonable in the morning?"
<Page47>
"Hold on. What do you mean by 'already'?
First of all, I do not talk about unreasonable things. I am merely asking for common sense."
<Page48>
Kohaku-san is impressed by Akiha's statement.
It's only the second day, but I think I'm starting to understand the relationship between these two.
<Page49>
"I will be heading to school, then.
Nii-san, as I said last night, curfew is strictly enforced. Did you check the news last night?"
"No, I haven't. Someone took my mobile phone, after all. Unreasonably so."
<Page50>
"I see. Then, I will have the morning paper ready in the living room from tomorrow on.
You might want to get up early and read through the day's news."
<Page51>
There you have it.
My attempt at sarcasm was deflected instantly by her ironclad attitude.
<Page52>
"According to the news, the body of a vagrant was found at the north gate of Souya Station last night. It is being reported that he either froze to death due to malnutrition or succumbed to blood loss."
<Page53>
"Whatever the truth is, it seems that the downtown area is not safe these days. It would be a disgrace to the Tohno family if you were to get involved in a trivial incident while wandering around there.
As soon as school is over, please try to get back to the mansion before the sun goes down."
<Page54>
After reminding me of the curfew, Akiha leaves the living room.
But... before the sun goes down means I have to be back by six o'clock. Wasn't the curfew set at eight o'clock?
