In the living room, I see Akiha and Hisui.
Akiha's uniform is from a famous school for young ladies called Asagami Private Girl's Academy.
<Page2>
"Y-Yo. Morning, Akiha."
"Good morning, Nii-san.
It seems that you woke up late this morning..... well, that is fine. I will just say that you did not sleep well on your first day."
<Page3>
"............"
The word "blunt" comes to mind.
I swallow the words "I was actually up earlier than usual" and sit down on the sofa.
<Page4>
"Hisui, please bring a cup of tea for Nii-san.
I will have another cup as well."
"Understood. Shiki-sama, would you like sugar in your tea?"
"Ah, yes. Just one spoon then."
<Page5>
And so, the awkward morning hour begins.
"..............."
"..............."
Hisui puts the teacup on the table, then goes back to waiting by the wall.
I silently take a sip of the dark red tea and--- #wait, what's this taste......?
<Page6>
"It's so delicious.......
It's bitter yet sweet, complex yet cleansing on the throat, and it smells just like Christmas......!"
<Page7>
I don't know what I'm saying, but that's how shocked I am.
I learned last night of the grandeur of the Tohno residence, and this tea was no exception.
<Page8>
"This morning we are having Esprit de Noel from Mariage.
The most famous tea stores are in England, but this is from France. It was founded around 1850 and only recently landed in Japan about 15 years ago...... so it is not a major brand, but the quality is good."
<Page9>
"Fufu..... The expression Christmas is so vague but strangely enough, it conveys the nuance."
I'm not sure if my expression was too funny, but Akiha is smiling with pride.
<Page10>
"I hear the price is fair, and it seems to fit the taste of my commoner brother quite well. Did you know that a fine leaf is worth its weight in gold?"
<Page11>
It was the condescending attitude of a ruler, looking down upon a pathetic, primitive man.
Even her gesture when placing the teacup on the saucer is elegant.
<Page12>
"Tch......."
But, unfortunately, she's right.
This tea is the real deal... what was the tea I've been drinking in the afternoon until now? I mean, you could certainly start a business or two with this. If such a thing existed in a time period where entertainment was scarce, even I would be ordering this in desperation.
<Page13>
About 10 minutes pass by.
"..............."
Both Akiha and I just enjoyed the tea without any conversation.
This was the result of us occasionally exchanging glances, but then returning our gaze to our teacups without anything to discuss over and over again.
To be honest, it was awkward to say the least.
<Page14>
Still, it wasn't a bad experience for me.
It's not something I can say as I had been left to my own devices until just recently, but just seeing Akiha spending her time like this in peace gives me an indescribable feeling.
I wonder if this is a relief....... I can't help but be happy that Akiha is in front of me right now, no matter what.
<Page15>
While I was immersed in this small sense of satisfaction, I hear a strange sound coming from the hallway.
<Page16>
"Major remodel , major romance!
Chaos, violence, and finally, insanity.
Stampede into hell!!"
Through the wall, a humming with no tempo whatsoever approaches.
<Page17>
"Hiii, good mooorning!
And good morning to you, family head chaaaan!"
<Page18>
Having dramatically opened the door, a woman with an appearance as outlandish as her entrance barges into the living room.
<Page19>
A coat that's one step short of being lingerie, and a tight leather skirt.
Her unusually long hair is arranged without rhyme or reason,
She doesn't seem to have any makeup on, but her lips are strangely alluring.
Her hair is reddish blonde, which combined with her tall stature makes her seem like a foreigner.
<Page20>
As far as I can see from her exposed chest and waist, she has an excellent figure.
The woman who arrived is "mature" in her own right, and would be more at home lying on a beach in the middle of summer than in an anachronistic Western-style building like this.
......Well, if it weren't for the oddly fitting lab coat.
<Page21>
"......Good morning, Dr. Arach.
What can I do for you today? I thought the routine check-up was yesterday."
<Page22>
"Well, I wasn't in the mood for it yesterday.
When I was watching the sunset, I got frustrated, so I abandoned my research and ran out to the city. Well, in short I just skipped work. So, I came here in the morning to get some work done today!
Oh, maid-chan, please give me some tea. Four or five spoonfuls of sugar, maybe six if you feel like it?"
<Page23>
The woman in white coat strolls into the living room.
Naturally, her eyes meet mine who was sitting on the sofa.
<Page24>
"What? Whaaat? Whaaaaaat---?
Oh? Hmmm? Mmmmmmmmm---?"
<Page25>
She's staring at me intently.
As if she came to an understanding after thoroughly observing me, #the woman seemed to smile mischievously---
<Page26>
"Hi---hihi, Uhihihihihihihihihihihihi!
T-This too good to be true---!
What's this, did the master come up with a plan to kill me with laughter? That's amazing, like A10 fully secreted from a dead mast cell!
Oh, my God, it's like Macbeth in this house! You're all rushing headlong into tragedy like it's already kill or be killed!"
<Page27>
The woman is laughing while grabbing her belly.
"..............."
There was nothing I could do but frown.
What's with this high-spirited person? Akiha calls her doctor, but.......
<Page28>
"Dr. Arach.
Could you make your introductions to Nii-san as well?"
As if she couldn't stand the sight of me being so lost, Akiha clears her throat and chides the woman in white.
<Page29>
"Hmm? Are you're talking about me? Or Shiki-chan?
It's okay, there's no point.
I've heard about him from Makihisa-kun.
He's not interested in the affairs of a stranger like me, right? Besides, if we want to talk about something, wouldn't we better off talking about Owner-chan?"
<Page30>
Makihisa-kun.....?
So, is this woman an acquaintance of my father?
<Page31>
"Well, I've always been a carefree woman, like a webless spider drifting in the wind,
but then fate brought me to Makihisa-kun.
"If you have nowhere else to go, why don't you come live with us?"
That's how cool he sounded when he said that! #But alas, He's not reaaaaaaally my type, so I simply turned him down, and so now I guess now we're friends? #Or something like that."
<Page32>
I look at Akiha searching for validation.
......It takes a lot of courage to talk to this woman.
<Page33>
"Yes. Dr. Arach was father's junior at the university.
As a friend of my father, she is now acting as my advisor."
<Page34>
"Eeeh? I don't like it when you call me that.
Pro-fes-sor. I'll cry if you don't call me Professor Arach with love and affection!"
<Page35>
Instead of crying, Dr. Arach smiles and laughs.
......But.
She smiles, but her eyes are fixed on my face like a sticky thread, as they have been ever since she came into this room.
<Page36>
"Here you go, Arach-sama. Your tea is ready."
<Page37>
Hisui intervenes.
Without reading the atmosphere...... no, without being affected by the atmosphere, Hisui neutralized the tension created by Arach.
<Page38>
"Oh, maid-chan really now. You really are the epitome of a maid."
......She's sulking because she was interrupted.
With one hand on her hip, she drinks the sugar-filled tea in one gulp as if drinking a sports drink.
<Page39>
"Ohh, sublime sugar! You're pervading all five of my senses! You're even making my uterus and my ovaries melt.. I feel it coming! Haah.. Thanks for the meaaal!"
<Page40>
"Well then, I'm off for a routine check-up! There's something wrong with the air conditioning in the large bath, right? I know, I know. I'll just do a quick check and then add an air steriliser or something while I'm at it!"
<Page41>
With a high-pitched laugh, Arach crosses the living room and heads to the hallway. .......However.
As she touches the doorknob, the woman turns to me and says,
<Page42>
"Nice to meet you, Shiki-chan. How about we get along as fellow outsiders?
A lot is going to happen from now on, but...
If you really can't help it anymore, why don't you try and come talk to me?"
<Page43>
The unwanted guest walks away, humming the same tune as when she arrived.
"..............."
"..............."
An inexpressible silence envelops the living room.
<Page44>
"Hey, Akiha."
"I do not know much about Dr. Arach either.
But due to father's will, she is in charge of the maintenance and management of the main building. I heard that father was a very good architect. But it seems that the construction industry was just a side business."
<Page45>
Akiha assures me firmly.
"What's with that woman?" I was the first to ask.
"I am not going to take any more questions." she says.
<Page46>
"If you'll excuse me. Akiha-sama, it's time for you to go to school.......#Hmm? There seems to be a tense atmosphere in here.
Haha. Did you already frighten Shiki-san by saying something unreasonable in the morning?"
<Page47>
"Hold on. What do you mean by "already"?
First of all, I do not talk about unreasonable things. I am merely asking for common sense."
<Page48>
Kohaku-san is impressed by Akiha's statement.
It's only the second day, but I think I'm starting to understand the relationship between these two.
<Page49>
"I will be heading to school then.
Nii-san, as I said last night, curfew is strictly enforced. Did you check the news last night?"
"No, I haven't. Someone took my mobile phone after all. Unreasonably so."
<Page50>
"I see. Then, I will have the morning paper ready in the living room from tomorrow.
You might want to get up early and read through the day's news."
<Page51>
There you have it.
It was an ironclad attitude that bounced back my little sarcasm in no time at all.
<Page52>
"According to the news, the body of a vagrant was found at the north exit of Souya Station last night. It is being reported that he either froze to death due to malnutrition or succumbed to blood loss."
<Page53>
"Whatever the truth is, it seems that the downtown area is not safe these days. It would be a disgrace to the Tohno family if we were to get involved in a trivial incident while out at such time.
As soon as school is over, please try to get back to the mansion before the sun goes down."
<Page54>
After reminding me of the curfew, Akiha leaves the living room.
But... before the sun goes down means I have to be back by six o'clock. Wasn't the curfew set at eight o'clock?
