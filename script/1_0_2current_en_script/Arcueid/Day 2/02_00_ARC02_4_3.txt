<Page1>
No, I'll just stay in my room.
It would be a shame to lose this feeling of satisfaction by walking around, since my body is now nicely relaxed after taking a bath.
Then, with a thump, I throw myself on the bed.
<Page2>
"Shiki-sama, are you there?"
"Yes!?"
I jump out of bed in a panic.
I wasn't doing anything wrong, but I feel like I was being accused of a mischief.
<Page3>
"O-of course I'm here. Please, come in."
"Yes, excuse me then."
<Page4>
"I am here to make the bed.
I know it is unpleasant for you, but please excuse me for a moment."
<Page5>
It's not unpleasant at all.
It's a luxury to have someone make the bed in your room.
However, I have learned in the past two days that if I mentioned that, it would trouble her.
<Page6>
"Thank you. I'll be quiet in the corner of the room, so don't worry about me, please."
<Page7>
I move to the corner of the room so as not to disturb.......
".................."
Hisui pauses for a moment, then silently begins and finishes making the bed.
<Page8>
The bed is as clean and neat as if it is newly made.
"Your bed is ready. Excuse me."
Hisui bows lightly and heads for the door.
<Page9>
"Ah, wait a minute---"
I stop her to thank her for making the bed.
I have no intention of grabbing her, but I reach out to touch her shoulder.
<Page10>
In a flash. Hisui's hand is sweeping my hand away.
"Ah......."
I'm surprised, but it is she who is even more surprised.
<Page11>
"......Sorry. I was trying to stop you, I just..."
I guess I'm feeling a little too relaxed after taking a bath.
It seemed like I was back in the Arima house, and misjudged the distance between us.
<Page12>
"......No. It is I who should apologize.
I am not used to being touched. ......Please forgive me."
<Page13>
Hisui's shoulders are trembling feebly.
I think it was excessive, but I was the one who frightened her.
<Page14>
"Anyway, sorry.......it's just, I felt like if I didn't stop you, you'd leave."
Hisui would have stopped just by my call. But earlier, for some reason, I had a feeling she wouldn't stop for that.
<Page15>
"No. You have nothing to apologize for.
It is me who is at fault. Please forgive me for offending you."
<Page16>
"No, you didn't offend me at all. ......But I guess I was really surprised. Hisui, you reacted so fast."
She reacted as fast as a kendo practitioner would.
If this is a dojo, I'd be applauding.
<Page17>
"That is not what ......I guess it is because I usually take care of the mansion."
Hisui lowers her gaze in embarrassment.
......Good. It seems that she understood that I was praising her.
<Page18>
"......I deeply apologize. I forgot you called for me earlier.
What can I do for you, Shiki-sama?"
<Page19>
"Ah, nothing---"
It's hard to say "I just wanted to thank you for making my bed."
I can talk about anything at......yes, that's right.
<Page20>
"I was wondering how Akiha was doing. Her school is a boarding school, right?"
<Page21>
"So you knew about it.
It is true that the school Akiha-sama attends is a boarding school. However as an exception, she is allowed to go to school from home."
"......In other words, #you mean she goes to school from this house?"
<Page22>
"Yes, But she rarely comes home in the evening like today. After a full day of schoolwork, she has lessons to attend, so she usually returns shortly before 7:00."	
"What kind of lessons, for example.....?"
<Page23>
"Today, she was learning the violin and a foreign language."
Today? .....Is she on such a schedule every day? She's been forced to practice a lot by the old man for a long time now, so it's probably not a surprise but.......
<Page24>
"In addition, until bedtime, the Tohno Group's business report for the day is given, and after waking up, until breakfast time, the details of the future businesses are confirmed."
<Page25>
"---Seriously?"
It is amazing enough.
Not only her mind and body, but also her lifestyle is made of steel.
<Page26>
"On weekdays, she returns before dinner, so if you wish to speak to her, please let Nee-san know after dinner.
If it is a holiday, Akiha-sama may be able to take some time off. I am sure she will be able to talk to you then."
"I-I see. Thanks, that was helpful."
<Page27>
Then with a bow, Hisui leaves the room.
But then again......
<Page28>
"Violin lessons, company executives......"
The people who are actually running the business are probably the higher-ups in each department, but "all the decisions" in the end are made by her.
<Page29>
"......It's not a bad thing that I was in the office, huh?"
I feel a mixture of guilt and honest respect.
<Page30>
In my memory, Akiha was a quiet, slender girl who always followed me with anxious eyes.
But now, she's taking over from father, while still managing to live her life as a student.
<Page31>
"---Yes, I know.
People change a lot in seven years."
Just as I've become the Tohno Shiki of today in seven years,
Akiha has become the Tohno Akiha of today in those seven years.
<Page32>
Seven years is a long time.
Roughly half of my life so far.
I wasn't in this mansion during the most important period of her life, when she was growing from a child to an adult.
<Page33>
"......I'm really not a good brother."
I mutter to myself, as if to ridicule myself of this obvious fact.
Even though I regret it now, it is still unforgivable.
I selfishly wonder if I could have eased Akiha's burden a little if I stayed with her for the past seven years.
