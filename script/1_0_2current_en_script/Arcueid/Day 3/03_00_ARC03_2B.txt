After having breakfast in the dining room, I go out to the lobby.
Behind me is Hisui, carrying my bag.
I suggested that I can carry my own bag, but she insisted on carrying it to the door at least.
<Page2>
...I seem to have a weak spot not only for Akiha but also for Hisui.
Oh, well, maybe I'm right, I do have a soft spot for Hisui.
<Page3>
In Akiha's case, she is simply correct so I lose legitimately. It is also true that Tohno Akiha's position is above Tohno Shiki's.
<Page4>
But Hisui is the complete opposite.
I'm in a position of power over Hisui, but I don't think I can use that power to my advantage.
I don't know, when Hisui stares at me, I feel like listening to anything she says...
<Page5>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san! Please wait a minute!#"
Kohaku-san comes down from the second floor with a clatter of footsteps.
"............"
Hisui steps aside as soon as Kohaku-san arrives.
<Page6>
"Hey, weren't you with Akiha?"
"Akiha-sama is on her way to school.
I stayed behind because I have to deliver something to you."
<Page7>
"A delivery for me?"
"Yes. Yesterday, I received a package from the Arima family."
Kohaku-san smiles at me.
<Page8>
"...? But I've brought all my stuff with me.
The things I used over there originally belonged to the Arima family. The only ones that belong to me are the clothes I'm wearing...."
<Page9>
"Is that so? This package was delivered to you though."
Kohaku-san hands me a thin wooden box, about twenty centimeters long.
It doesn't weigh much.
<Page10>
"---Kohaku-san. I've never seen this before."
"I was told it was in your father's belongings. I also heard he left it to you in his will."
<Page11>
"...My father left this to me?"
...I don't know how to feel.
Why would Tohno Makihisa, the man who kicked me out of this mansion seven years ago, leave me a parting gift?
<Page12>
"Oh well. Kohaku-san, take this to my room."
"-----"
Kohaku-san is staring intently at the wooden box.
She seems almost like a child who wants to see a toy.
<Page13>
*stare*
No, she is a child.
<Page14>
"...I see. You're curious about what's inside, aren't you?"
"No, not at all.
I'm just curious as to what kind of gift it is."
...No, you're curious enough, maid-san.
<Page15>
"Then, let's open it. Ready? Open."
The crate is opened with a soft, dry sound.
Inside there is a thin iron rod, about 15 centimeters long.
<Page16>
"It's...an iron rod."
An unadorned, well-worn iron rod.
<Page17>
...My father must have really hated me to leave me a piece of junk like this.
Besides, the iron bars my father used were a bit thicker and more rugged---
<Page18>
"That's wrong, Shiki-san.
This is a fruit knife, isn't it?"
Kohaku-san takes the iron rod out of the box.
<Page19>
"You know, there are knives whose blades pop out.
It's like that. Okay, here we go."
<Page20>
With a snap, a blade that is about ten centimeters long springs out.
...I see, this is indeed a knife.
<Page21>
"The blade looks new, but the outside looks very old. Look, the year and era it was made are engraved on the grip."
<Page22>
Kohaku-san retracts the blade and hands me the knife.
...There is indeed a number engraved on the bottom of the grip.
The character 'seven', and under it, the character 'night'.
<Page23>
"Nee-san, there is no era by that name.
It only says 'Nanatsu-yoru'."
"Eh...!"
When I turn around, I see Hisui who was silent until now, peering at the knife from behind.
<Page24>
"Y-you surprised me...don't scare me like that, Hisui.
You don't have to look over my shoulder like that if you want to see, here."
<Page25>
"Ah-------"
<Page26>
"P-please excuse me.
Um...that dagger is so beautiful, I could not resist."
"Beautiful? I don't know if I'd call it that.
It looks rather dull and old-fashioned."
<Page27>
"No, it is not. I think it is an ancient and venerable sword."
"...Is that so? It looks like a piece of junk to me...."
<Page28>
Since Hisui is so adamant about it, I'm starting to feel the same way.
...Yeah.
Maybe this isn't a bad idea for a memento as it is.
<Page29>
"'Seven Nights'...is it? Maybe that's the name of this fruit knife?"
I don't think many people name their knives...whatever it is, it's definitely vintage.
<Page30>
I put the blade away in my bag. It's a violation of the Firearms Act, but I hope they'll overlook it for at least one day.
I'll show it to Arihiko later and brag about it...well, that is, if he's at school.
<Page31>
"Shiki-sama. Are you ready to go...?"
"Oh, no, I'd better get going or I'll be late.
Okay, Kohaku-san, thanks for the delivery."
"No problem." says Kohaku-san, waving us off.
<Page32>
When I leave the gate of the mansion, I notice that there is a lot of noise.
<Page33>
"...What is it? Isn't it kind of noisy over there?"
"The thing is, they found some blood on the road this morning."
"Blood...? You mean...bloodstains?"
<Page34>
"Yes, there was also blood on the wall of the mansion.
It seems that while you were asleep, the police came to inquire about what happened last night."
<Page35>
"Does that mean there was a dead body or something...?"
"No, they only found traces of blood."
"------"
<Page36>
The national road east of the mansion, ---that's where I went to check last night.
Bloodstains...splattered, caked red.
At that time, there was no such conspicuous color anywhere.
There was only black. Only the biting cold. The warmth of blood was not there.
<Page37>
"Shiki-sama?"
".....No, it's nothing.
I'll see you later. Thanks for seeing me off."
<Page38>
"Have a good day. Please take care on your way."
<Page39>
Hisui bows deeply.
I'm just going to school, so I don't need to be careful, but I think she's concerned about my health in her own way.
<Page40>
"Thank you. I'll try to be careful. Take care of yourself, Hisui."
I raise my hand lightly, thank Hisui, and leave the gate of the mansion.
