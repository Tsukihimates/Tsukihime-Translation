After finishing lunch at the cafeteria, I return to the classroom.
As there is still some time before the fifth period, there are only a few boys and a group of girls who remain in the classroom.

"......Huh?#"
I just realized.
I didn't see Yumizuka Satsuki among the girls.
She is the third most noticeable...if not the most noticeable, and when she's not here, it makes me feel uncomfortable.

"...I wonder if she's absent."
I'm so out of touch that I didn't notice it until lunchtime.
The new homeroom teacher didn't say anything about it, so I guess she is just sick for a while.
