After finishing my lunch in the cafeteria, I return to the classroom.
Since there's still some time before fifth period, the only people left in the classroom are a smattering of boys and close-knit groups of girls.//　まだ五時限目まで時間があいている事もあり、教室に残っているのは数名の男子と、女子の仲良しグループたちだ。

"......Huh?#"
I just realized.
I didn't see Yumizuka Satsuki among the girls.
She is the most... well, maybe the third most eye-catching girl in the class. When she's not here, it's enough to make me feel uncomfortable.//　彼女は一番……といわずとも三番目ぐらいには目立つので、いなければそれだけで違和感になる。

"...I wonder if she's out today."//「……欠席だったのかな」
To think I didn't notice until lunchtime, I must be pretty out of it.
The new homeroom teacher didn't say anything about it, so I guess she's just out sick today.
