"Hey, Akiha.
About last night, is it like that here every night?"
"---What?"
"Like I said, I'm talking about last night.
You and the others couldn't sleep either, right?"
"I slept fine last night...what are you talking about?"
"What am I talking about? I'm talking about the dog, of course.
A wild dog was barking all night around 11 o'clock."
Akiha and Kohaku-san look at each other and then look at me with concern in their eyes.
...I don't like the fact that they're thinking I'm a sleepwalker or something like that.
<Page2>
"Fine, I won't ask you.
Kohaku-san, it was loud last night, wasn't it?"
<Page3>
"---Well, I'm not sure.
I think it was windy last night, but the only unusual thing we found during our midnight patrol was that you were asleep on the bed in your uniform."
"...Ah, you mean that? I'll be more careful from now on."
<Page4>
"What? What happened, Kohaku?"
"No, nothing really happened.
It's just that Shiki-san was sleeping a little rough, that's all."
<Page5>
With a smile on her face, Kohaku-san let Akiha's question slide.
<Page6>
"...Are you sure neither of you noticed?
Last night, there was a wild dog barking outside for half an hour. Woof woof woof woof, it was so loud."
<Page7>
"Aha, you mean like in WanWan Panic, right?"
I couldn't quite tell by her reaction, whether she believes me or not.
<Page8>
"...In short, that's it in a nutshell."
"Hmmm---I do not remember any of that though.
Neither do you, right, Kohaku?"
<Page9>
"I suppose so... I'm sorry, Shiki-san but I don't think that happened."
<Page10>
"That is settled then. The only other possible cause is that Nii-san was dreaming of a dog barking at him."
"......Ugh."
<Page11>
When both of them say that, now I'm not so sure.
...When I think about it, it's strange that I heard that howl. There were no dogs outside, and the road---
<Page12>
There was no one on the street.
The more they say it was a dream, the more I think it was.
<Page13>
"You are not used to the mansion yet so that must be the reason why you had such a bad dream.
Let us see, if the wild dogs continue to bark tonight, I think I will get a very ferocious guard dog."
Akiha smiles wickedly.
<Page14>
"It is time for me to go, so I will leave you to it. Nii-san, please be careful not to get attacked by dogs on your way to school."
<Page15>
Akiha gracefully leaves the living room.
To see her master off, Kohaku-san gives me a bow and then proceeds to leave the room as well.
