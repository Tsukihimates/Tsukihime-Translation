Before homeroom.
The classroom is more lively than usual.
<Page2>
The boys and girls are having silly arguments about Noel-sensei's evaluation.
Fortunately, I don't belong to either camp. So, I walk across the classroom to my seat without a care in the world and find...
<Page3>
"Hey. You're late, Tohno."
My seat by the window is occupied by a man who doesn't belong in a morning classroom, waiting for me with a smirk on his face.
What's more,
<Page4>
"Good morning, Tohno-kun."
He is accompanied by an unexpected person.
<Page5>
"Senpai? Why are you in this classroom?"
<Page6>
"Oh, is it so unusual? I just dropped by to see if you were in class."
"That's unusual. Normally, upperclassmen don't come to lower classes. Isn't it embarrassing to be in the underclassmen's class as someone completely different?"
<Page7>
"Is that so? Tohno-kun, you're rather thoughtful about details. But I'm fine with it. We're all from the same school anyway."
What great benevolence, I can't even speak.
<Page8>
"No, but third and second year classrooms are still too far apart... and you'll be late for homeroom if you don't go now."
"I see", she nods earnestly.
<Page9>
"Don't worry about that. I'm a fast runner, despite my appearance. It takes me less than a minute to get to my class downstairs."
"Ahem", she replies, quite proud of herself.
"......"
Senpai is an upperclassman who is tough, both mentally and physically.
<Page10>
"You talk too much, Tohno.
It's fine, she came here because she wanted to..."
<Page11>
Arihiko, for his part, is sitting on someone's desk, chatting happily with Senpai.
<Page12>
".....Okay. But you have to go back to your class, two minutes before homeroom starts, Senpai."
I sit down on my chair with a sigh, feeling really tired.
<Page13>
"...Inui-kun, Tohno-kun doesn't seem to be in a good mood."
"...Yeah, I think that he's having a temper tantrum because he doesn't like living in a new place. He doesn't mind most things, but he has a bad habit of lashing out when he doesn't understand something."
<Page14>
"...Is that so? He doesn't seem like the type to be very angry."
<Page15>
"...No, this is not true. He looks calm, but when he goes off, he really goes off. Rather often. With a crack."
"...Hah. Crack, is it?"
<Page16>
"...Yeah, yeah. Once he loses his temper, he'll lose all sense of control, so don't trust him, even if you're his upperclassman."
...They are talking secretly in private.
<Page17>
"...You know what? If you want to talk in private, can you do it in the hallway? I can hear what you're saying at my desk, and it's giving me a headache, you know."
"No way!! You heard me, Tohno!"
<Page18>
...I heard you.
He even pretended to be talking in private and approached Senpai, and casually extended his hand to her waist, only to be struck down by her merciless hand.
I felt depressed before getting angry at such a blatantly theatrical performance.
<Page19>
In the meantime, Senpai is hiding her mouth with her hand, I wonder how serious she really is.
...She might have thought that she was really talking in private.
<Page20>
"Oh, that's why you're a liberal arts glasses guy. Listening to me and Senpai talking about our love affair is beyond pathetic. ...#Hmm, are you that frustrated every day? Is your new sister that beautiful? Can you introduce her to me next time?"
"Arihiko, in short, are you trying to start a fight with me?"
<Page21>
"Of course not. You and I are great friends! I'll fight with my parents if I don't like them, but I won't fight with my best friend, that's my policy. Basically, I'm a man who lives by chivalry."
<Page22>
That's great.
In his head, chivalry means that it is okay to raise your hand against your own flesh and blood.
<Page23>
"I see. That's a rotten policy you've got there."
"Hey, you're pretending to be down, but you're really the same old Tohno! Really now. I was so worried about you!"
Bang, bang, my self-proclaimed best friend pats me on the back.
<Page24>
"...You've been watching out for me, haven't you?"
"Don't ask such a silly question.
Isn't it noble to do such things casually?"
Bang, bang, bang, he pats me on the back.
...We've known each other for a long time, but I still can't get a full grasp of his personality.
<Page25>
"So, how's the new house?
From the looks of it, you're under a lot of stress." #"Who knows, I don't know. At any rate, I had a strange dream last night, and when I told the people in my house about it, they didn't believe me."
"Hmm. I see, that's unfortunate."
Arihiko makes a serious face and nods his head.
<Page26>
"........."
---And then.
When I thought that she is keeping quiet, Senpai is staring intently at me and Arihiko having a trivial conversation.
<Page27>
"Senpai?"
"Tonho-kun, you're really close with Inui-kun, aren't you?"
"Are you serious? If you think so after seeing that, your glasses aren't properly adjusted."
<Page28>
"That's not true. You're careless when you're in front of Inui-kun. You're defenseless and trust him completely."
For some reason, Senpai smiles happily.
"?"
She looks at Arihiko and nods her head.
<Page29>
"I envy you. I admire having friends who can understand each other like that without any hesitation."
Hoh, says Senpai seemingly impressed.
""Is that so?""
Arihiko and I look at each other, furrowing our brows.
<Page30>
"And, it's about time. I'm going back, Tohno-kun, did you see the news this morning?"
"Oh, ...I've been so busy I forgot. I haven't seen it yet."
<Page31>
"I see. Well then, let me ask you, there was a mansion on the news this morning. Was that your house?"
"Eh?"
<Page32>
I remember Hisui saying that the police came over to question us.
<Page33>
"Ah, it might have something to do with my house.
I heard that the police came over to talk to us this morning."
"I see. Tohno-kun, don't play around too much at night."
<Page34>
Senpai quickly walks away.
We watch her walk away in silence.
<Page35>
"Mm-hmm ---Now then, hey Tohno."
"What is it? I won't answer you if it's something stupid."
"It's not stupid. The big question is, when did you become so close to Senpai that she started coming to see you."
<Page36>
"That's hard for me to answer that question. We've only started talking recently, and today was just a whim, wasn't it?
I mean, you seemed friendly with her too."
"Not really. It took seven days for her to remember my name."
<Page37>
"Oh, that's unusual. Isn't your policy not to deal with women who don't fall for you in a day because they're a pain in the ass?"
<Page38>
"With most women, yes. But not Senpai.
I've been keeping it a secret, but the truth is, I prefer..."
"You're saying you like older women who look good in glasses, right?"
Ugh, Arihiko's cheeks flushed.
<Page39>
"Do you get it, buddy?"
"I know. It's a bit of a stretch, but Senpai said we're best friends. I can tell when you're serious or not.
She's really cute. You can't talk to her and not like her. I'm the same."
<Page40>
"I see, I see.
So you understand how great she is as well, ---wait. #What are you trying to say?"
"If we are best friends, we will get along with each other and have similar interests. It's not surprising that the types of girls we like are also similar."
<Page41>
We look at each other for a while.
Finally, Arihiko nods seriously and says,
"It was a short friendship, Tohno."
"Yeah, it was."
Waving my hand, I see Arihiko off.
At the same time, the bell for the start of homeroom rings out.
