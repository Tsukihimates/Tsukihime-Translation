Before homeroom.
The classroom is more lively than usual.
<Page2>
The boys and girls are having silly arguments over Noel-sensei.
Fortunately, I don't belong to either camp. So, I saunter across the classroom to my seat without a care in the world, and then...
<Page3>
"Yo. You're late, Tohno."
My seat by the window is occupied by a man who doesn't belong in a morning classroom, waiting for me with a smirk on his face.
What's more,
<Page4>
"Good morning, Tohno-kun."
He is accompanied by an unexpected guest.
<Page5>
"Senpai? Why are you in this classroom?"
<Page6>
"Oh, is it so unusual? I just dropped by to see if you were in class."
"That's unusual. Normally, upperclassmen don't come to lower year classes. Isn't it embarrassing to be in an underclassman's class as an outsider?"
<Page7>
"Is that so? Tohno-kun, you're rather fixated on the small details. But I'm fine with it. We're all from the same school anyway."
What great benevolence, I can't even speak.
<Page8>
"No, but the third and second year classrooms are still quite far apart... and you'll be late for homeroom if you don't go now."
'I see', she nods earnestly.
<Page9>
"Don't worry about that. I'm a fast runner, despite my appearance. It takes me less than a minute to get to my class downstairs."
'Ahem', she replies, quite proud of herself.
"......"
Senpai is an upperclassman who is tough, both mentally and physically.
<Page10>
"You talk too much, Tohno.
It's fine, she came here because she wanted to..."
<Page11>
Arihiko, for his part, is sitting on someone's desk, chatting happily with Senpai.
<Page12>
".....Okay. But you have to go back to your class two minutes before homeroom starts, Senpai."
I sit down on my chair with a sigh, feeling somewhat tired all of a sudden.
<Page13>
"...Inui-kun, Tohno-kun doesn't seem to be in a good mood."
"...Yeah, I think that he's having a temper tantrum because he doesn't like living in a new place. He doesn't mind most things, but he has a bad habit of lashing out when he doesn't understand something."
<Page14>
"...Is that so? He doesn't seem like the type to get angry."
<Page15>
"...No, that's not true. He looks calm, but when he goes off, he really goes off. Rather often. In a snap."
"...Hah. Snap, you say?"
<Page16>
"...Yeah, yeah. Once he loses his temper, he'll lose all sense of control, so don't trust him, even if you're his upperclassman."
...The two of them are whispering secretly to each other.
<Page17>
"...You know what? If you want to talk in private, can you do it in the hallway? I can hear what you're saying at my desk, and it's giving me a headache, you know."
"No way!! You heard me, Tohno!"
<Page18>
...I heard you.
He even pretended to be talking in private, approached Senpai, and casually extended his hand to her waist, only to be struck down mercilessly.
Rather than getting angry, I felt depressed by such a blatantly theatrical performance.
<Page19>
In the meantime, Senpai is covering her mouth with her hand out of surprise. I wonder how serious she really is.
...She might have thought that she was really talking in private.
<Page20>
"Oh, that's why you're a liberal arts glasses guy. Listening to me and Senpai talking about our love affair is beyond pathetic. ...#Hmm, are you really that frustrated every day? Is your new sister really that beautiful? Can you introduce her to me next time?"
"Arihiko, seriously, are you trying to start a fight with me?"
<Page21>
"Of course not. You and I are great friends! I'll fight with my parents if I don't like them, but I won't fight with my best friend, that's my policy. Basically, I'm a man who lives by chivalry."
<Page22>
Well, aren't you great?
In his head, chivalry means that it is okay to raise your hand against your own flesh and blood.
<Page23>
"I see. That's a rotten policy you've got there."
"Hey, you're pretending to be down, but you're really the same old Tohno! Sheesh. I was so worried about you!"
'Smack, smack', my self-proclaimed best friend hits me on the back.
<Page24>
"...You've been watching out for me, huh?"
"Don't ask such a silly question, dummy.
Isn't it noble to do such things casually?"
'Smack, smack, smack', he hits me on the back again.
...We've known each other for a long time, but I still can't get a full grasp on his personality.
<Page25>
"So, how's the new house?
From the looks of it, you're under a lot of stress."# "Who knows. At any rate, I had a strange dream last night, and when I told the people in my house about it, they didn't believe me."
"Hmm. I see, that's unfortunate."
Arihiko makes a serious face and nods.
<Page26>
"........."
―――And then.
While I thought that she was keeping quiet, Senpai was staring intently at me and Arihiko having a trivial conversation.
<Page27>
"Senpai?"
"Tohno-kun, you're really close with Inui-kun, aren't you?"
"Are you serious? If you think so after seeing that, there must be something wrong with your glasses."
<Page28>
"That's not true. You're much more open when you're in front of Inui-kun. You seem to trust him a great deal."
For some reason, Senpai smiles happily.
"?"
Arihiko and I look at each other and tilt our heads.
<Page29>
"I envy you. I admire friends who can understand each other like that without any hard feelings."
Senpai breathes out in approval.
""Is that so?""
Arihiko and I look at each other, furrowing our brows.
<Page30>
"Well, it seems it's about time. I'm going back, but Tohno-kun, did you see the news this morning?"
"Oh, ...I've been so busy I forgot. I haven't seen it yet."
<Page31>
"I see. Well then, let me ask you directly. There was a huge mansion on the news this morning. Was that your new house?"
"Eh?"
<Page32>
Now that she said that, I remember Hisui saying that the police came over to question us.
<Page33>
"Ah, that must have been talking about my home.
I heard that the police came over to talk to us this morning."
"I see. Tohno-kun, you shouldn't play around too much at night."
<Page34>
Senpai quickly walks away.
We watch her depart in silence.
<Page35>
"Mm-hmm ―――Now then, hey Tohno."
"What is it? I won't answer you if it's something stupid."
"It's not stupid. The big question is, when did you become so close to Senpai that she started coming to see you?"
<Page36>
"It's hard for me to answer that question. We've only started talking recently, and today was just on a whim, wasn't it?
I mean, you seemed friendly with her too."
"Not really. It took a whole week for her to remember my name."
<Page37>
"Oh, that's unusual. Isn't it your policy to avoid dealing with women who don't fall for you in a day, because they're a pain in the ass?"
<Page38>
"With most women, sure. But Senpai's different.
I've been keeping it a secret, but the truth is, I prefer..."
"You're saying you like older women who look good in glasses, right?"
Arihiko's cheeks redden.
<Page39>
"Do you get it, buddy?"
"I know. It's a bit of a stretch, but Senpai said we're best friends. I can tell when you're serious or not.
She's really cute. You'd be weird to talk with her and not end up interested. The same goes for me too."
<Page40>
"I see, I see.
So you understand how great she is as well, ―――wait.# What did you just say?"
"If we're best friends, we'll get along with each other and have similar interests. It's not surprising that the type of girl we like is also similar."
<Page41>
We stare at each other for a while.
Finally, Arihiko nods solemnly and says,
"It was a short friendship, Tohno."
"Yeah, it was."
Waving my hand, I see him off.
At the same time, the bell for the start of homeroom sounds.
