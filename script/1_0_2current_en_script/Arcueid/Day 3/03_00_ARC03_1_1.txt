"Hey. Good morning, Akiha."
At any rate, I decide to greet Akiha first.
<Page2>
"...Good morning, Nii-san.
I do not sense any energy in your greeting, did you sleep well last night? You look like you are about to collapse."
<Page3>
 "Unfortunately, that's just my face. Don't expect me to greet you with high spirits in the morning."
I'm not sure what happened last night, but I don't want people to think that I'm a juvenile delinquent who stays up late.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Shiki-san.
If you would like some breakfast, I can serve it in the dining room, so please feel free to ask me anytime."
On the other hand, Kohaku-san has this soothing effect. Like the north wind or the sun maybe?
<Page5>
"Thank you very much.
But have you finished already, Akiha? From the looks of it, you're having an after breakfast tea."
<Page6>
"Of course. I do not care what time you wake up, but at least make sure you have enough time for breakfast.
Having breakfast after seven o'clock is a sign of sluggishness."
<Page7>
I resist the urge to say, "No, seven o'clock is normal. This house is not normal to begin with."
<Page8>
"Hmm. What time do you get up, Akiha?"
"I wake up at five o'clock, what about it?"
"...I'm sorry, My mistake."
Despite talking about things that ordinary people don't think about, she has an expression of "Is this weird?" on her face. I'm taken aback when she gives me a look like that.
I've never seen a more perfect response from her. 
<Page9>
"? What did you mean by "your mistake"?"
"No, nothing...but what are you doing up so early? Trying not to be late?"
<Page10>
"Listen here. Unless there is a serious problem, I will not be late. That will never happen.
Your school is about a half-hour walk from here, right? It is not that far, so do not be late. It is embarrassing."
<Page11>
Well, her thorny words are really sharp and prickly.
However, all of her points are correct, and I can't think of any objections.
It's natural for Akiha to be concerned about the reputation of the Tohno family, no, as the head of the family, she must fulfill it.
<Page12>
"Yeah, yeah. I'll try not to be late, regardless of my grades.
And about staying up late---"
As I said this, I remembered what had happened last night.
I don't want to stay up late, but it's the same if there are external factors that make me lose sleep.
