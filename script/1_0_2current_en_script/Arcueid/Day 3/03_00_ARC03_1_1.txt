"Hey. Good morning, Akiha."
At any rate, I decide to greet Akiha first.
<Page2>
"...Good morning, Nii-san.
I don't sense any energy in your greeting, did you sleep well last night? You look like you're on the verge of collapse."
<Page3>
 "Unfortunately, that's just my face. Don't expect me to greet you with high spirits in the morning."
Regardless of what happened last night, I don't want my greetings to make people think that I'm some kind of delinquent, staying up late.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Shiki-san.
If you would like some breakfast, I can serve it in the dining room, so please feel free to ask me anytime."
On the other hand, Kohaku-san has this soothing effect. Like the north wind and the sun maybe?
<Page5>
"Thank you very much.
But have you finished already, Akiha? From the looks of it, you're having an after breakfast tea."
<Page6>
"Of course. I do not care what time you wake up, but at least make sure you have enough time for breakfast.
Having breakfast after seven o'clock is a sign of sluggishness."
<Page7>
I resist the urge to say, "No, seven o'clock is normal. This house is not normal to begin with."
<Page8>
"Hmm. What time do you get up, Akiha?"
"I wake up at five o'clock, what about it?"
"...I'm sorry, my mistake."
Despite saying something that would be unthinkable for a normal person, she is wearing an expression that says "is that so strange?". I can't help but be dumbfounded.
I've never heard such a perfect response.
<Page9>
"What do you mean your 'mistake'?"
"Ah... Nevermind that, what are you doing up so early? Trying not to be late?"
<Page10>
"Listen here. Unless something serious happens, I will not be late. That will never happen.
Your school is about a half-hour walk from here, right? It's not that far, so do not be late. It would be embarrassing if you were."
<Page11>
Well, she's prickly as ever.
Given that everything she said was right, I can't think of any objections.
It's natural for Akiha to be concerned about the reputation of the Tohno family, no, as the head of the family, she must be.
<Page12>
"Yeah, yeah. I'll be mindful of the time, regardless of my grades.
And about staying up late---"
As I said this, I remembered what happened last night.
I'm not the type to stay up late voluntarily, but if something keeps me up, it's the same outcome.
