...Somewhere, I hear the sound of rain.
It's a long, dense drizzle of rain.
<Page2>
"-----"
I'm dizzy.
My throat hurts when I breathe.
"Hur....ts."
A voice comes up.
"----Shiki-sama?"
Just then, I hear someone's voice and presence nearby---
<Page3>
"It's---my room."
Before I know it, I'm lying down in my own room.
I put on the glasses from my bedside table.
<Page4>
"Good evening, Shiki-sama."
"Hisui...?"
"Yes. How are you feeling?"
"......"
<Page5>
Hisui asks me a strange question.
There's nothing wrong with my body.
<Page6>
"Wh---y?"
Yes, why?
Why am I sleeping in this place---?
<Page7>
"I---killed som---"
I almost said "I killed someone" but I cover my mouth.
That's the only word that my reason tells me not to say.
<Page8>
"Hisui...why am I here?"
"...Do you not remember, Shiki-sama?"
Hisui frowns faintly.
<Page9>
"We received a call from the school saying that you had left early. However, you didn't come back in the evening so my sister went to look for you and she found you resting in the park."
"The park---the park nearby?"
<Page10>
"Yes. You were resting on a bench and then walked back to the residence on your own."
"...No way. I don't remember that at all."
<Page11>
"I do not think it is so strange that you do not remember.
Your consciousness could have been clouded by weakness caused by anemia."
<Page12>
"........."
...I don't remember any of that.
But there is no doubt about what Hisui said.
<Page13>
"...Ah, it's already nine o'clock at night. ...I didn't notice it."
"Yes. When you got back here, you said you wanted to rest in your room. I tried to call for a doctor, but you said, 'It's the usual'."
<Page14>
"---I see.
It's true that my anemia is always a problem, but---"
<Page15>
...It was different this time.
I've killed someone--no, wait.
<Page16>
"Hisui. What was I wearing?"
"---What?"
"What was I wearing? My shirt, my shoes, there was bloo---"
They were all wet and sticky.
<Page17>
"If you are talking about your uniform, it was dirty so I washed it."
"Did you simply wash my bloody clothes...?!"
<Page18>
"...It is true that it was covered in mud, but there was no stain of blood. Besides, it was only your shirt and pants that were dirty, not your jacket or anything else."
<Page19>
"------"
...Unbelievable.
I was kneeling in a pool of blood and my legs and arms were red...?
<Page20>
"Shiki-sama, did you have a bad dream or something?
You must have had a terrible nightmare your face is still pale."
Hisui is staring at me.
<Page21>
"I was dreaming---wasn't I?"
Was it all a dream?
That feeling.
The smell of blood.
That miraculous white girl.
"Yeah, ---that's right. That was a bad dream."
<Page22>
I let out a long sigh.
----That's right.
It was a bad dream.
It's not like I was going to break a promise I made to Sensei when I was little and do something like that for no reason.
<Page23>
"Aah----I'm awake."
"If you are feeling up to it, I can prepare dinner for you."
<Page24>
"Eh...no, dinner is. "
...Even if that was a dream, I still can't get the color and smell of that blood out of my mind.
<Page25>
"I'm sorry, I don't feel like it.
I'm going to sleep like this tonight. More importantly, Hisui."
"Yes. anything else, Shiki-sama?"
"You told me that I came back in the evening. did Akiha say anything?"
<Page26>
"Akiha-sama was not at home at that time, she came home about two hours ago so I told her about your condition."
<Page27>
"What about it?" Hisui asks silently.
<Page28>
"It's nothing, really.
I've been here for three days, and I'm sure she's disgusted by the trouble I've caused her."
<Page29>
"...It is true that Akiha-sama was worried, but she did not seem upset."
After saying that, Hisui takes a step back.
<Page30>
"Now, if you will excuse me.
If you need anything else, please let me know."
<Page31>
"Ah, thank you---And I forgot to ask one more thing."
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"It's raining outside, isn't it? I wonder how long it's been raining."
"It started before you arrived. When my sister found you, you were soaked in the rain."
<Page32>
"........"
No. I don't even remember that happening.
I must have been severe anemia...if that is the case, I should've just stayed home and rested.
<Page33>
"Good night. I'm really sorry about today.
Please tell Kohaku-san I said thanks."
"Understood. ---Please have a good night."
<Page34>
"---Haah. So it was a dream."
...The words I muttered were cold and chilly.
I can't really feel it at all.
The realization that what I was thinking,
was actually a dream.
<Page35>
Outside, there is the sound of rain.
My head is still faintly heavy.
I look at my chest.
...The old scars from seven years ago are still clearly visible, like burn marks.
<Page36>
"...Ah."
On the desk in the room is a knife, a memento from father.
"-----"
...It was a dream.
It was nothing more than a dream.
I close my eyelids, repeating this to myself as if to deceive myself.
<Page37>
...I exhale a long, long breath as if I'm trying to clear my lungs of the scent that I've taken in.
I surrender to the dark sleep that cuts off my consciousness.
<Page38>
When I was a child.
I think someone told me not to tell lies that I couldn't even fool myself with.
