Fifth period.
The lesson on ancient Japanese literature is making me sleepy, but I continue writing in my notebook.
Our high school has not yet approved the use of electronic devices for note-taking. The school said that they will eventually move to using tablets, but it seems to be a few years away.
<Page2>
However, the use of mobile devices in class is not discouraged. It's an unspoken agreement.
Even now, some students use their cell phones to read dictionaries, some to exchange e-mails, and some to browse websites.
I'm more of an analog person myself, so I write the contents of the class by hand like an old-fashioned student.

"----"
It happened suddenly.
A sharpening of consciousness akin to acceleration.
A perspective that flips, twists, and flutters toward a point.
A sense of equilibrium as if my brain itself is spinning in circles.
<Page4>
My vision wavers.
I feel that something is coiling at the back of my head and that my consciousness is about to tumble out of my skull.
<Page5>
"...This is..."
I know this feeling.
This sudden dizziness is a precursor to anemia.
...I let my guard down. I knew this could happen to me at any time, but I let my guard down.
<Page6>
I hate this...I don't usually collapse in class but---
<Page7>
In my darkening vision, I reach out and grab my desk to lean on it.
But it's all for naught.
I can't put any strength into my fingertips.
All that's left is for me to fall to the floor---
<Page8>
"Sensei, may I have a word?"
---And then.
Bam, someone hits me on the back roughly.
<Page9>
"Tohno's not feeling well, so I'd like to take him to the infirmary."
Before I know it, Arihiko has come up to me.
"Tohno, are you not feeling well?"
I hear the teacher's voice from the podium.
<Page10>
"No, I'm fine like th---"
"Ah, no, he's not fine at all.
Shouldn't you send him home early?"
...Arihiko says something selfish in a loud voice.
<Page11>
"Is that so? The doctor has told me about Tohno's condition too. Tohno, If you're not feeling well, you can rest in the infirmary or leave early and go home."
....Maybe he's a good person after all.
The literature teacher seems to believe Arihiko's statements.
<Page12>
"Come now, you can go home now. You look so pale. No one's going to know if you're feeling bad until you tell someone, you know."
Arihiko hits me on the back grumpily.
"...I'm going to leave early then, Sensei."
"Mmm." the literature teacher nods solemnly.
<Page13>
"...My bad, Arihiko. I didn't mean to make you worry needlessly."
"Don't worry about it. I've known you since middle school so I can tell right away when you're about to collapse from anemia."
<Page14>
Arihiko goes back to his seat.
I manage to get up from my seat and leave the classroom with a heavy feeling in my body.
<Page15>
I leave the school building.
I thought about going to the infirmary to rest, but at this hour there is a high possibility that I would fall asleep until nighttime.
That being the case, I decided that it would be better to push myself a little and go back to the mansion.
<Page16>
"Phew...I think I'm feeling a little better."
As I breathe in the fresh air, I begin to feel rejuvenated.
<Page17>
Seven years ago.
Perhaps, this is the price of recovering from an accident that almost took my life, but since then, I've developed a condition that leads to chronic anemia.
<Page18>
When I was first discharged from the hospital, I used to fall ill with anemia every day.
Because of my condition, I missed many things, but thanks to the people around me, nothing serious ever happened.
<Page19>
Now that my body has grown, I don't get dizzy or anemic anymore as long as I don't recklessly strain myself.
Even so, I can't stop myself from getting dizzy and losing consciousness from time to time.
Today I was lucky that Arihiko caught me, but normally I would have fainted.
<Page20>
"------"
I take a slow, deep breath, letting the fresh air fill my lungs.
Holding back the stagnation that has settled in the middle of my head, I leave the school.
<Page21>
I walk out onto the street in front of the station.
...I can't believe it. This proves that I'm still in a daze.
I almost went into the ticket gate out of habit.
<Page22>
The place I'm going to is not the Arima house. It's the Tohno mansion. There's no need to take the train from here anymore.
<Page23>
"----ugh"
I'm still not feeling well.
I put my hand on my forehead, and it's hotter than usual.
<Page24>
If I push myself too hard and collapse on the side of the road, there is nothing I could do.
"...I can't help it, really."
I sit down on a bench, disgusted with myself.
I'm going to take a break until I feel better.
