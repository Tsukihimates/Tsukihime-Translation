"Good morning, Kohaku-san. It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?"
"Yes, good morning, Shiki-san."
<Page2>
Kohaku-san returns my greeting with a big smile on her face.
<Page3>
"Did you sleep well last night?
You were spending the night in an unfamiliar mansion, so I was worried that you might feel unwell."
<Page4>
"Don't worry, I was just uncomfortable with how high the ceiling is, but the rest is fine. I used to live here anyway, and now I have you to take care of me."
"Oh. You're quite good, Shiki-san."
"No, no. It's a fact."
<Page5>
I exchange words with Kohaku-san in a harmonious manner.
In just a few days, I've gotten to know her very well.
It's not that I'm a good communicator but it's the power of her smile.
---However.
<Page6>
I notice another set of eyes staring at me silently from earlier.
"Oh, cra-- ---#Hi."
I raise my hand lightly in greeting.
Akiha is staring at me, or rather, glaring at me.
<Page7>
""Oh cra-", is not a familiar greeting, Nii-san.
I wonder if there is more to come after that."
"No, there is not. There is nothing after that."
I answer immediately without moving my eyebrows. Or rather, the muscles of my face, not just my eyebrows, are stiffened by tension.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Akiha. Nice day this morning, huh?"
<Page9>
"Oh, you do not have to force yourself to greet me.
Please, feel free to ignore me. It seems like you want to have a nice morning with Kohaku.
Ah, if you like each other so much, would you like to have Kohaku as your maid then? I would not mind that at all."
<Page10>
"...You're on full blast first thing the morning huh."
My sister's <power|biting words> is amazing.
As a brother, it would have made sense for me to talk to her first...
<Page11>
"Akiha-sama, please don't tease Shiki-san too much. He doesn't have much time, and he hasn't eaten breakfast yet."
<Page12>
"The reason he has not eaten with his breakfast is that he woke up late. It is his own fault that his mornings are so rushed."
With a hmph, Akiha replies.
For starters, it seems that she is not happy that I did not show up in time.
<Page13>
"Kohaku-san. Is my breakfast ready by any chance?"
"Yes, It's all set. If you give the word, I can prepare your meal right away.
<Page14>
"You can't do that, Kohaku. It is already this late, and you, Nii-san, do not have time for breakfast. You will be late for school."
<Page15>
"No, no, no. It's just after seven, so there's plenty of time.
It's only a little more than a half-hour walk from here to my high school.
"In other words, you only have 10 minutes for breakfast, have you not? You are not a hungry dog, you should take your time with breakfast."
<Page16>
"Mm, guh--"
She was right on target with my inadequacies. ...I must say, she has terrific reaction speed and reflexes.
It's like a wall that constantly repels the ball in tennis practice. I'm not going to say that aloud though.
<Page17>
"...Nii-san.
Did you say something strange just now?"
"No, nothing. Really, nothing.
Besides, what did you mean by "I'm not a dog", Akiha---"
<Page18>
And then, I remember.
Speaking of dogs, I need to confirm what happened last night.
