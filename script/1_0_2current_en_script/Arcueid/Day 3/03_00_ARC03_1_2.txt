"Good morning, Kohaku-san. It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?"
"Yes, good morning, Shiki-san."
<Page2>
Kohaku-san returns my greeting with a big smile on her face.
<Page3>
"Did you sleep well last night?//「昨夜はよくお眠りになられましたか？
You were spending the night in an unfamiliar mansion, so I was worried that you might feel unwell."
<Page4>
"Don't worry, I had trouble relaxing with a ceiling that high, but otherwise I was fine. I used to live here anyway, and now I have you to take care of me."//「大丈夫、天井の高さに落ち着かなかったくらいで、あとはぜんぜん。昔はここに住んでいたんだし、今はちゃんと気を配ってくれる琥珀さんがいますしね」
"Oh. You're quite good, Shiki-san."
"No, no. I'm just stating facts."
<Page5>
Kohaku-san and I exchange some friendly words.
In just a few days, I've gotten to know her quite well.
I'm not especially good with people or anything. Maybe it's just the power of her smile?//　俺がコミュニケーション上手なのではなく、琥珀さんの笑顔の力だろう。
―――However.
<Page6>
I notice that another set of eyes have been staring at me this whole time.
"Oh, cra―― ―――#Hi."
I raise my hand lightly in greeting.
Akiha is staring at me――no――glaring at me.
<Page7>
"'Oh cra――', is not a customary greeting, Nii-san.
I wonder if there is more to come after that."
"No, there's not. There is nothing after that."
I answer immediately, without batting an eyelid. In fact, my whole face is stiff with tension, let alone my eyelids.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Akiha. Lovely weather this morning, huh?"
<Page9>
"Oh, you do not have to force yourself to greet me.
Please feel free to ignore me. It seems like you want to have a nice morning with Kohaku.
Ah, if you get along so much, would you rather be her valet then? I would not mind that at all."
<Page10>
"...Full throttle first thing in the morning, huh?"//「……朝から全開だなおまえ」
My sister's <power|b i t i n g  w o r d s     > is amazing.//ruby spaces intentional
As her brother, it would have made sense for me to talk to her first...
<Page11>
"Akiha-sama, please do not tease Shiki-san too much. He does not have much time, and he has not eaten breakfast yet."
<Page12>
"The reason he has not eaten his breakfast is that he woke up late. It is his own fault that his mornings are so rushed."
With a hmph, Akiha replies.
For starters, it seems that she is not happy that I did not show up on time.
<Page13>
"Kohaku-san. Is my breakfast ready by any chance?"
"Yes, it is all set. If you give the word, I can prepare your meal right away."
<Page14>
"You cannot do that, Kohaku. It is already this late, and you, Nii-san, do not have time for breakfast. You will be late for school."
<Page15>
"No, no, no. It's just after seven, there's plenty of time.
It's little more than a half-hour walk from here to my school."
"Well, you only have ten minutes, no? You are not a starving dog, you should take your time with a meal."
<Page16>
"Mm, guh――"
She calls out my inadequacies with pinpoint precision... I have no choice but to acknowledge her formidable quick wit and supernatural reflexes.
She's like a flat wall that constantly repels the ball in tennis practice. I'm not going to say which part is the wall though.
<Page17>
"...Nii-san.
Were you about to say something strange just now?"
"No, nothing. Really, nothing.
Besides, what did you mean by 'I'm not a dog', Akiha―――"
<Page18>
And then, I remember.
Speaking of dogs, I need to confirm what happened last night.
