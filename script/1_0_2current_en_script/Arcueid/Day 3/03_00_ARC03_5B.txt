...I watch the crowd in front of the station in a daze.
It's a little past two in the afternoon.
The bustle of the city continues unabated.
A large number of people pass by.
I don't know their names or their identities, but each of them is heading towards their own destinations without looking at anyone walking right next to them.
<Page2>
Despite all these people being in the same place, they all continue on within the single-minded limits of their own personal journey.
Like how everyone is their own main character,
they are living each day that passes with themselves at center stage.
<Page3>
They see everything, but at the same time nothing at all.
Their respective days do not intersect and do not branch out anew.
<Page4>
The wisdom to obtain the minimum amount of order in society with the least amount of effort.
Necessary but uninvolved individualism seems to be the path chosen by mankind.
<Page5>
"........"
Perhaps I'm feeling sentimental because of the slight fever.
"...Let's go home."
I feel calmer now and staying here will only make me indulge in strange thoughts.
<Page6>
I stand up from the bench and blend in with the crowd.
With my thoughts dulled by anemia, I head for the mansion.
All I want right now is to be left alone in my room, take off my glasses, close my eyes and become an organ that does nothing other than breathe.
@g ―――That is, until I crossed paths with that woman.
<Page7>
"――――――"
@gI thought that time had stopped.
@gEverything in me remembers that moment as if I'd been sucked in.
<Page8>
@g―――Throb.
@gGolden hair and red eyes.
@gWhite clothes. A white figure.
@gA snowfield with no footprints.
@gAn unblemished silhouette, reminiscent of a sacred mountain beyond human comprehension.
<Page9>
@g―――Throb.
@gMy pulse rises.
@gMy heart beats erratically.
@gMy veins and arteries activate.
@gMy nerves split one after the other, and my spinal cord heats up in a hallucination.
<Page10>
@gTo say that I was entranced would no doubt mean that I am in a state of obsession.
@gMy feet have already stopped.
@gI look back at the figure of the woman who had left my field of vision, trying not to lose sight of her.
<Page11>
"―――,―――――――――"
@gI find myself forgetting to breathe.
@gI feel nauseous.
@gI can't breathe.
@gI'm suffocating.
@gI can't remember how to breathe properly no matter how much I try.
<Page12>
"―――,―――――――――"
@gMy throat is burning.
@gMy eyeballs feel like they're going to shatter.
@gMy palms are wet and slippery.
@gMy blood is running low, and my fingertips are so cold I can't feel them.
@gI'm sweating so much.
<Page13>
@gI remember that I am a living thing.
@gMy breathing restarted on its own.
@gBut the reason――――
<Page14>
         I didn't make any mistakes.
         I didn't choose anything.
         I just wanted to go home.
<Page15>
@gReason.
@gI vaguely realize that the tightrope I tricked myself into walking has now been cut.
<Page16>
"Haa――――haa―――――haa――――"
@g...I have to chase her.
@gI have to chase that woman.
@gChase, chase, chase, and then talk.
@gI move my frozen feet.
@gMy breathing has become hot like ■■■■.
@gSeeking the figure of the <woman|prey  > in white.//spaces are intentional
<Page17>
"Haa――――haa――――haa――――"
@gThe woman is walking slowly.
@gShe's not interested in me at all.
@g―――A faint question crossed my mind.
@gNot interested? That's absurd. Is that really the case? But the fact is, she's not aware of me at all. Did something happen? There must have been something. She's probably very tired. Exhausted. Drained. That's why there is an opportunity. The reason I feel this way is because, when all is said and done, I'm confident that /I can ■ her/.
<Page18>
@g 	.her at sneering I'm if as her lick to want I
@gWhen was the last time I satisfied my desire.
@g 	.pieces thousand a into her slice to want I
@gNot as a replacement for masturbation or intercourse, but for a simpler, more primal desire.
@g 	.her savor can I so down her cut to want I
@gI don't remember what it is. In the first place, I'm still,
@g 	.content heart's my to her ■ to wait can't I
@gI don't even remember the 'first time'.
<Page19>
@g'Haa', I let out a gasp that doesn't sound like my own.
@gI clutch my chest to hold back the boiling emotions.
@gThe woman swimming in the crowd is beautiful, both pure and desirable.
<Page20>
"―――――――"
@gMy throat is aching.
@gI haven't been able to breathe properly for a while now.
@gWhat's wrong with that? It's only natural.
@gAfter witnessing such a ■, it would be rude for a creature to not get excited.
<Page21>
@gI take something out of my bag.
@gI put it in my pocket and start to walk.
@gI feel the touch of iron on my fingertips.
@gI am truly blessed.
@gThis tool is just perfect.
<Page22>
@gHow wonderful. I'm going to come. What a sensual encounter.
@gI must keep a good distance.
@gDon't be noticed.
@gDon't let anyone around us get in the way.
@gThat woman and I are complete strangers.
@gSo I have to follow her scent as naturally as possible.
<Page23>
@gThe woman enters an apartment complex.
@gAn automatic glass door. The security is perfect.
@gNo one can even enter the hall unless they're residents.
@g I go around to the emergency exit, take off my jacket and leave it somewhere hidden. I cut. And go inside.
<Page24>
@gThere's no one in the hall.
@gI look at the elevator. The light has stopped at the top floor.
<Page25>
"――――――"
@gI press the call button. I go inside.
<Page26>
@gAt that moment, I'm overwhelmed by her remaining presence.
@gThe lingering scent of that woman makes my mouth twitch upwards.
<Page27>
@gI'm excited.
@gIn the tight confines of this closed room, I clutch the object in my pocket.
@gShe's right here, near me.
@gNot much longer, I can finally   her.
<Page28>
@gI get out of the elevator.
@gI sense that there is no one in the hall.
@gI get out of the closed room. I head for the hallway. Not a soul in sight.
@gI can't think.
@gThere is only one word that pops into my head.
<Page29>
@gWoman.
@gThat woman.
@gAt this rate, I'm going to――――――
<Page30>
@g―――I'm in front of room number three.
@gThis must be it. All the other rooms are empty. Am I sure? Yes, I am. This sense of smell is a natural part of being an animal. I merely forgot this fact during my lazy existence. It's shameful. It's unforgivable. There's nothing I can do about it. The rules of civilized society are so gentle and harmless that such a trivial impulse can become fatal.
<Page31>
"―――,―――――――"
@gI go to press the doorbell but stop.
@gMy glasses are in the way.
@gI can't do what I came here for with these on.
<Page32>
"―――Got it?
Don't ever look at things thoughtlessly, okay?"
<Page33>
"....."
@gThere was a woman who told me that a long time ago.
@gBut now I can't remember her name or face.
<Page34>
@gI slowly take off my glasses.
@gThe squirming lines look like aging wrinkles.
<Page35>
@gI don't know what I'm doing.
@gWhat am I trying to do?
@gWhy am I doing this?
@gWhat does Tohno Shiki―――want to do with that woman from earlier?
<Page36>
@gI don't know.
@gI don't know, but I press the doorbell.
<Page37>
"Yes―――"
@gA voice comes through the door. The door opens.
@gIn that moment.
@gI slip into the room through the small gap.
<Page38>
"Eh――――"
@gThe woman raises her voice.
@gOr she tries to.
@gThe woman who I had such an obsession with, whose voice that I had yearned to hear, did not last forever.
@gBefore I know it, the whole thing is over.
<Page39>
@gThe moment I enter the room, I hear a 'kaching', the sound of a hammer falling.
@gThe sound of the door. The creak in my brain. The alarm bell of the end.
@gIt was none of them. So then, what was it?
@gThere's no need to explain. It could only be one sound.
@gThe sound of the knife being released.
<Page40>
@gAt that moment, I pass through the lines running along the woman's body.
@gStab.
@gCut.
@gPass.
@gRun through.
@gCut her into pieces.
@gCompletely and utterly, I kill her.
<Page41>
@gA total of seventeen lines on her body.
@gNeck, back of the head, right eye to lip, upper right arm, lower right arm, right ring finger, left elbow, left thumb, middle finger, left breast, ribs to heart, stomach to the abdomen in two places, left groin, left thigh, left shin, left toe, all of them.
@gPassing through each, without taking even a second.
@gIn truth,   in the blink of an eye,   it's all over.
I dismantled her into seventeen pieces of meat.
<Page42>
"―――Eh?"
I hear a stupid, idiotic voice.
I didn't realize that it came out of my throat.
<Page43>
I feel lightheaded and dizzy.
There are pieces of something scattered in front of me.
On the marble floor, a red liquid spreads out like an overturned bucket of water.
The smell of blood is revolting.
The cuts are very clean, with no organs spilling out.
<Page44>
Only the red color invades the floor like a wave.
It's a strange story.
There is nothing in the room, just the dismembered limbs of the woman and myself standing there.
<Page45>
"―――What the―――"
The red encroachment is too vivid.
In my hand, I hold the murder weapon, a knife.
<Page46>
"She's―――dead."
Of course.
There isn't a human that could survive something like that.
<Page47>
"Wh―――y?"
There's nothing, nothing at all.
Just now, with my very own hands.
Did I, with my own hands, cut this woman I didn't even know to pieces so easily?
<Page48>
"Did I―――kill her?"
There is no doubt about it.
Or perhaps that's not the case?
I have no reason to. So no, it can't be. But there never was a reason from the start. That's why it's wrong, it can't be right. I'm the only one here. There was another person here a moment ago, but now I'm the only one alive. So no. It has to be. But there's no reason, there's no reason, I didn't want to, I wasn't, I wasn't in my right mind. I was never sane in the first place. So it's not, it's not―――
<Page49>
―――The red blood spreads across the marble floor.
Oozing slowly.
I can feel the red blood on my feet.
<Page50>
".........Ah."
I lift my shoes in surprise, but not in time.
The woman's red blood sticks to my feet and the floor like coal tar.
<Page51>
"―――――――"
Aaah. I-It's, blood.
Because I broke her apart, the disgusting color continues to flow sluggishly even now.
<Page52>
"―――It wasn't me."
Yes, it has to be a mistake.
A mistake. A mistake. It has to be a mistake, nothing else.
This must be―――
C:>This must be some kind of a bad dream.
C:>...No, this is a reality wrought by my own hands.
