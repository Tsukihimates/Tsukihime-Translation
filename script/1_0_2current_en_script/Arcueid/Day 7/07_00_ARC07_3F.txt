 We return to the park. //Check this scene carefully! It's my favorite one so far.
 Arcueid has recovered during the walk and is back to her old self.
<Page2>
 "You're back to normal so easily... Are you sure you didn't just let your guard down and get hurt earlier?"
 "Eh...? No, it's true that the wound is just beginning to heal."
<Page3>
 "...It's true that you're just starting to heal, huh?
 Doesn't that mean you said some things that weren't true?"
 "Hmph. What are you talking about? You're so annoying."
<Page4>
 "Your behavior is too suspicious.
 If you have a problem with me, tell me what you were doing just now.
 I have a pretty good idea, but what were you doing that hurt you so bad?"
<Page5>
 "......
 Well! Then I'll tell you my goal, just like you wanted!"
<Page6>
 "......."
 She's blatantly sidetracking...
 Well, that is what I really want to know.
 I'll ask about Arcueid's condition later.
<Page7>
 "So, let me get this straight.
 That guy back there, he was a corpse acting as a puppet for the vampire?
 His controller, is that your real enemy?
 "Wow. You're picking it up pretty fast this time, Shiki."
<Page8>
 "Thanks. I'm not totally stupid, you know. I think I get what's going on."
<Page9>
 "Yeah, good, good.
 It's good that the only cute little misunderstanding you had was about Vlov.
 "Don't call it cute... I had no choice. I had my hands full as it was."
<Page10>
 "Hmmm. Had your hands full, huh?
 Well, let's just leave it at that."
<Page11>
 As I wonder what's so funny about it, Arcueid turns and faces me.
<Page12>
 "Just to be clear... That guy from earlier, he's already dead, isn't he?"
<Page13>
 "That's right. I only got rid of him because he was their servant.
 He was a low-grade undead, but even so, if I let him go, he would kill humans and accumulate power.
 Shiki, do you remember what I told you about vampires at the hotel?"
<Page14>
 "Of course," I nod back.
 ...The biology of vampires.
 ...The relationship between the lord of the castle and his subordinates.
<Page15>
 The vampire who becomes the master attacks and kills humans, creates servants called the dead, and then leaves the servants to collect blood while they hide.
 Arcueid referred to such vampires as "castle lords" and "old-fashioned vampires."
 A stereotypical vampire, immortal and vulnerable to sunlight.
<Page16>
 "I've already learned that.
 ...So you're sure that the enemy you're after is the vampire who killed those people?"
<Page17>
 "Yes, I'm sure.
 Even if they only had a hand in the beginning, all the murders by the dead that resulted from it would also be their doing.
 So..."
<Page18>
 "You walk around the city like you did earlier, looking for the vampire's servant.
 ...So you can find out their master's whereabouts?"
<Page19>
 "If the servant is strongly attached to the 'master', then yes. But so far, all I've found were the wrong ones.
 The coffin... I can't find out where it is when the enemy is using so many of the dead."
<Page20>
 "They've only gotten their hands dirty a few times. The rest of the time, they can control the people they've made as the deads and expand their territory while they sleep."
 The number of casualties in this city is over a hundred.
 The victims that you people made so much noise about are tiny compared to the people who disappeared without being seen."
<Page21>
 "――――"
 ...Once again, hearing that fact makes my blood freeze.
 Two days ago, I thought that Vlov was the source of the problem.
 Therefore, my mind was directed only at killing <my enemy|Vlov>. That was the only thing keeping me sane.
<Page22>
 But not now.
 The incident is still going on.
 More than a hundred people have been murdered. People who were attacked, drained of blood, and killed, they're all orginated from the same person.
<Page23>
 The blood-sucking victims have become new monsters, roaming the streets as moving corpses, just like the mass of lines I saw earlier―――
<Page24>
 Three days ago.
 I remember the people staying at the hotel that were killed.
 I was in the hotel, but I didn't see the actual scene.
 I could only imagine it, without experiencing firsthand how horrific the violence was.
<Page25>
 It's the same now.
 When I hears that there were vampires that sucked human blood while slowly expanding their territory, I didn't fully understand it.
<Page26>
 ―――Then.
 What would I think if someone close to me was killed like that, without any reason or warning?
<Page27>
 ...Understand that it's immoral just to imagine it, I think a little.
 I imagine Akiha with her blood sucked out, thrown away like trash.
<Page28>
 "――――"
 The dizziness that seems to be eating away at my brain is overcome by exhaustion.
 My heart, which should have been furious, is strangely calm.
<Page29>
 I tell myself that now is the time to think instead of tremble.
 Realize that such an event could happen tomorrow.
 After that, I can blame my own helplessness and cowardice for not realizing the danger sooner.
<Page30>
 "You're still angry, Shiki.
 ...The reason I didn't want to tell you this――― it's too terrible of a thing for a human to know.
 Since, to you, the actions of a vampire would be unacceptable."
<Page31>
 I suppose that's true. I don't know if it's good or bad, forgiveable or not.
 The only thing I know for sure is that I cannot accept it.
<Page32>
 Even if I don't know a person's face, they have a <weight|past> to carry. As its opposite, there is an <outlook|future> that is proportional to that weight.
 Even if it's something I don't know, something I don't understand, it's not so little that I can dismiss it easily.
<Page33>
 ...Yet, I don't want to get killed like it's some kind of game. //check this page
 It's too frustrating. It's too frustrating.
 It's all――― it's just too meaningless.
<Page34>
 "But don't worry, Shiki.
 It seems like the natural enemy of vampires doesn't exist in this country, but I'm here now.
 Didn't I tell you? My goal is to exterminate the vampire that is invading the city.
<Page35>
 Ignoring the somber atmosphere from earlier, Arcueid changes and becomes cheerful.
 Honestly, that statement is encouraging.
 I know how great this girl is and how many human lives she's protected.
 It was Arcueid who prevented the cold wave from Vlov without even thinking about herself.
<Page36>
 ...But, there are still some things that don't add up.
 Even before I fought Vlov, it's a natural question for any human to have.
<Page37>
 "...I don't understand.
 I thought Arcueid was a vampire too. Why would you do something like this, like being on the side of humans?"
<Page38>
 "I'm not on the side of humans.
 I'm just doing it because I have nothing else to do."
 "―――?"
 Nothing else, to do...?
<Page39>
 "Well, I guess that's why I'm being targeted. It's like a necessary evil."
 "...No. I don't know what you're trying to say, but I'm pretty sure that's the wrong metaphor."
<Page40>
 "Hey, hey. Don't sweat the small stuffs.
 I was such a hot commodity, full of hate, but Shiki managed to beat Vlov, didn't you? Now there's are no obstacles whatsoever."
<Page41>
 "Now I'm just going to find the "enemy" that's hiding in this city and take care of them.
 You should go back to your normal life, so you don't have to deal with us."
<Page42>
 "Ah――― Sure. That's great, but―――"
 But―――are you okay with being alone?
 Those words pop into my mind, and I shake my head.
<Page43>
 ...I'm out of my mind.
 It's crazy to feel guilty about letting this one girl do something so dangerous.
<Page44>
 "......"
 "Shiki? What's up, you're making a strange face again.
 That's all you wanted to hear, wasn't it? I don't think there's anything else."
<Page45>
 ...No, I have so many other questions that I want to ask you, but right now―――
<Page46>
 "...Idiot. Of course I'm making a strange face. This is a problem for the city I live in."
<Page47>
 "But, you don't have to worry about it.
 From now on, I'm going to look around the city every day and make sure no one else gets killed.
 Or do you not trust my capability that much?"
<Page48>
 I don't want to get involved either.
 ...But, that phrase.
 The line about protecting this city should be uttered by me, who lives here, not Arcueid―――
<Page49>
 "...Arcueid. That "enemy" you speak of, are they strong?
 More so than Vlov, I mean."
 "Not at all. Vlov was one of the top ancestors.
 The vampire that has nested in this city is less pure than he was."
 "Okay. Then, you won't get hurt, will you?"
<Page50>
 "I can't say for sure. I think I would have been fine a while ago, but now I'm sick. It's likely that the enemy has more power than I do."
 ......
<Page51>
 Hey, wait, I nod at the familiar words.
 Arcueid is sick...?
<Page52>
 "Hold on, did you catch a cold or something?
 I mean, do vampires even catch colds?"
<Page53>
 "Yeah, one hell of a savage street thug.
 Haven't you ever heard about the malicious Tohno-Shiki virus?" //Tohno Shiki is written in katakana here, any fun ideas on how to TL it?
 "Ah――― no, that is, the... I'm sorry."
 I kicked the hornet's nest.
<Page54>
 "I'm kidding, the wound you made has already healed. It's just that I'm a little tired from using more strength than expected to heal it.
 The one that hurts is the one I got from Vlov. This thing is still just blocking it from the outside."
<Page55>
 Arcueid lightly touches her abdomen.
 -That scar.
 That's an extra wound she got from protecting me.
<Page56>
 "――――"
 I have no words.
 I'm the one who's making Arcueid suffer.
 And yet.
 Why is this girl smiling at me so vulnerably, without even a hint of resentment?
<Page57>
 "...Just stop. Why don't you just take a break somewhere, at least until the wound heals? A day or two off won't make a difference."
<Page58>
 "I can't. The enemy must have known I'm here because of my fight with Vlov. If I rest, it's like letting them know I'm weak."
<Page59>
 "...Then, does that mean you're going to keep doing what you did tonight?"
 "Yes. Since I'm not sure where my enemy is, I'll have to destroy all the dead feeding them.
 If I cut off the source of food, the main body will appear to suck blood directly."
<Page60>
 "What if it appears tomorrow!?
 If you try to conceal your injuries, they could turn the tables and kill you! So-"
<Page61>
 As I tell her not to push herself, my face falls.
 Arcueid is right―――If she shows such weakness, the enemy will try to kill her with all their might.
<Page62>
 More than anything else, I know it from those two days.
 In battle, Arcueid is thoroughly serious.
 It's not about how to fight without hurting herself, it's about how to defeat her enemy without fail.
 She prioritizes the achievement of her goals above all else. She will not deceive herself in the process.
<Page63>
 "―――"
 Arcueid can't be stopped.
 If I let her go, I won't be able to talk to her like this again.
 She is so unafraid of her own death that it boggles my mind.
<Page64>
 ...So then, why is she still smiling at me?
 If only I hadn't seen that face of her's... If only she had acted more like a vampire, I wouldn't be feeling this way.
<Page65>
 "What's the matter, Shiki?
 You're shaking, do you need to use the bathroom?"
 "How are you―――like that?"
 Absurdly, there's no tension.
<Page66>
 ...I look up from my slumped position.
<Page67>
 "?"
 In front of me stands the girl in white. //White woman spotted.
<Page68>
 ...I can't possibly pretend it didn't happen.
 I don't know what this emotion is.
 It's just that the two days I spent with this girl are something I'll never forget.
<Page69>
 Then―――To leave here and now, knowing that even by tomorrow night she might be dead, regretting it over and over again like the fool that I am――― Surely, it would be too painful to bear.
<Page70>
 "...Give me a break. I've got two broken eyes and a broken head..."
<Page71>
 I don't want anything to do with vampires anymore.
 It reminds me of my fight with Vlov. That alone sends a chill down my spine, the fear of being one step from death is still there.
<Page72>
 It's the same now. This time, my opponent will be completely beyond me. There's no need for me to get involved at all.
 Arcueid says she'll take care of it, so just leave it to her.
<Page73>
 ...So, why?
 Despite knowing the reasoning to that point.
 Even then, I just can't leave this girl alone―――
<Page74>
 "Ah, come on, what's wrong with me?!"
 I kick the ground with a thud.
 I'm frustrated by my inability to accept any kind of logic or persuasion.
<Page75>
 "Wha, what is it? Shiki, you're getting angry all of a sudden."
 "Of course I'm angry! Why am I even trying to say this crap after what I've been through?!"
 I feel even more dizzy as the words leave my mouth.
 I'm such an idiot, if I had a mirror, I'd definitely smash it!
<Page76>
 "Wait, slow down. You're not being normal."
 "Yeah, I'm not normal! If I was normal, I wouldn't be able to say something like this...!"
<Page77>
 Cursing, I scratch my head in disgust.
 I hate to admit it, but it's already decided.
 Because now, I've admitted it with my own mouth.
<Page78>
 "Hey, I don't understand at all!
 Explain it to me! You've been saying this and that for a while now, what's are you going on about?"
<Page79>
 "I told you! #I'm going to help you until your body heals, that's what I'm trying to say!"
 "―――, Eh?"
<Page80>
 Arcueid looks at me with a dumbfounded expression on her face.
 After all this, finally, or rather, barely, I mean... //idk if yatto is barely or at the end, so I just leave them be for now.
 Anyway, I said what I wanted to say clearly and then I finally feel calm.
<Page81>
 "Shiki. Just now, are you sure?"
 "......"
 "Mmm," I groan.
 I still can't believe it either.
<Page82>
 "Sorry, I think I missed that.
 Could you say it again, please?"
 "............"
 "Mmmmm," I groan.
<Page83>
 But even if I regret it, it's too late.
 Once I said the words, I couldn't even lie to myself anymore.
<Page84>
 "Come on. I want to hear that line again."
<Page85>
 Arcueid whispers a request.
 I avert my gaze from her flowery smile and try to make my voice sound as sullen as possible.
<Page86>
 "It's like I said. I'm responsible for your weakness, and I can't leave the monster that's infesting the city alone.
 You're too weak to do it alone, so I said I'd help you if I could."
<Page87>
 "Shiki―――!"
 Arcueid's eyes light up.
 She grabs my hand and shakes it up and down in a happy manner.
<Page88>
 "...Well. I won't be much help, but it's better than nothing."
 "Yes! If Shiki is helping me, there's nothing to be afraid of!"
<Page89>
 Shake, shake, shake. Arcueid still hasn't let go of my hand.
 I was afraid that if I was swung around by this girl's foolishness, I might eventually slip out, but I just couldn't bring myself to stop.
 ...What can I say?
 That girl really is smiling, happily.
<Page90>
 So, just like that――― I accept with a bit of pride that this ridiculous choice will not be a mistake.
