Let's search around the city without giving up.
In the first place, we met by chance.
There is not such a natural relationship like "we can meet if you go there".
If I don't want to rely on coincidence, I need to mobilize all my intuition and feet to find that mysterious white back.
<Page2>
"......That's right. That's what going out to meet people is all about. I've been relying on my phone too much."
<Page3>
When mobile devices were not yet widely used.
Even if you missed someone at the meeting place, you could find them by yourself if you considered their lifestyle and way of thinking.
It was not a 'wild intuition', but a natural human ability. Even if we are used to cell phones nowadays, there is nothing that we can't do.
<Page4>
......However, my range of operation is small.
I should probably head to either the residential or the downtown area.
<Page5>
"............Okay."
I gave it some thought and decided on the downtown area.
While alternately monitoring the north and south gates of Souya Station, I shall head towards the downtown area.
<Page6>
No matter how crowded the place is, if she's still in this city―――if that back of her is still there, I will not miss her.
<Page7>
"No, not at all."
I didn't have any wild intuition or anything.
Maybe I'll find her soon? I had a feeling.
Maybe she'll be in front of this station next time! I couldn't find her like that, either.
I was completely lost.
<Page8>
It's been a long time since I had such a refreshing waste of time and energy. It may be an overstatement, but it could even be my first time.
Because I never knew when anemia would strike, I tried not to take any "useless actions".
<Page9>
......When I think about it, I wonder why I made such an unreasonable choice
I wonder why I made a groundless assumption that "I might be able to find her".
<Page10>
"But the night is just beginning.
Just a little bit more of exploring..."
<Page11>
I got an email on my cell phone.
I wonder who it was, was it Arihiko? I took it out and found that it was ......
<Page12>
"Shiki-san.
Please hurry back to the mansion.
Because we have a surprise visitor."
<Page13>
"It's a very beautiful foreign woman who claimed to be "Shiki-san's girlfriend" and
Akiha-sama seems to be displeased with not only the morning incident but also about Shiki-sama not returning.
What's with your heart?"
<Page14>
It was such a mysterious email from Kohaku-san.
"―――#What the...?"
My mind went blank.
So...... Arcueid is now in the Tohno's mansion?
My thoughts can easily comprehend the worst, but it refuses to comprehend it now.
<Page15>
I was naive. I was really naive.
 Why did I think that I could predict Arcueid's actions based on common sense?
<Page16>
"It makes too much sense even for that!" #I run to the Tohno's residence with the speed of a rabbit.
<Page17>
It's scary to even imagine what kind of things Arcueid is saying.
And I'm already dying just imagining what kind of impression Akiha would have think when she heard it. ......!
<Page18>
Okay, I've broken my best record.
I ran up the heart-breaking slope and arrived at the Tohno's residence, out of breath.
However,
<Page19>
"............gulp"
The breathing that has been disrupted by running at full speed calms down.
My shoulders, which have been moving up and down violently, becomes quiet.
<Page20>
As it should be, the Tohno residence now has an intimidating feel to it, as if it were the introduction to a horror movie.
I mean...
<Page21>
"Well, just in time.
Are you ready for this, Nii-san?"
<Page22>
......Oh no.
I didn't know humans could be forced to prepare for death so easily......?
<Page23>
But there was no way out for me, as a brother.
The situation can only get worse if I remain in fear.
I made up my mind and rushed into the evil Western-style house.
<Page24>
"It seems you are finally home.
.......If you had been a minute later, I did not know what would have happened."
