The basic knowledge of vampires that I heard at the hotel is enough.//ggwp
This time, let's ask a more in-depth question.
<Page2>
"Not about the dead that we talked about earlier, but a more dangerous one......
Twenty-Seven Ancestors, right? You said earlier that Vlov was one of them, but what are they really?"
<Page3>
"Ah, do you ask that?
I knew you'd ask about it!"
<Page4>
"Ahh I get it, I get it, it would be after defeating Vlov.# Shiki really gets his teeth into it huh~!" //get one's teeth into is a idiom 
"Y-Yeah?"
<Page5>
Was that the question she's been waiting for?
While Arcueid was being pulled from the waist while eating with good vigor.
<Page6>
"As I said before, the Twenty-Seven Ancestors are the pinnacle of the Dead Apostles. You can compare them to kings.
But we need a little more prior knowledge when talking about the Ancestors."
<Page7>
"Ta-da!
Yes, The advanced vampire course is going to start."
<Page8>
A whiteboard appeared with a squeaky sound.
I'm already used to this, so I'm not really surprised anymore, I'll just clap my hands.
<Page9>
"Applause? Is that an applause just now?
Hmmmm... for a Shiki with such a boring face, at least that reaction is good!"
<Page10>
No, I'm just not sure on how to react, so I just put on a serious face for the time being.
I just want Arcueid to be more serious about this.
<Page11>
"Those who become vampires from humans are classified as the 'dead', but they have different stages based on their abilities and limitations.
This is how they look like as a staircase."
<Page12>
"I won't explain it in details though,
up to the III rank is 'living corpses', //活ける死体 @specifictermsexpert
then Rank IV and V are the 'nightkins' that live at night
and finally, Rank VI, where it becomes a vampire that is capable of creating a community."
<Page13>
"Those who have made it to Rank VI are the ones who can fully become independent as vampires.
By making children through blood sucking, they can become the apex... parents of the group that they have created.
However, they can't make a child above Rank VI, for a normal vampire, their 'rise' stops there.
<Page14>
"........."
Vampires transfer their own blood to humans and transforms them, making those humans their slaves.
And the collection of those slaves that have been multiplied in that way is what a 'vampire community' is.
<Page15>
If you can't make more 'children, then surely the staircase will stop there.
However...
<Page16>
"There must be something that created this.... no, there is a vampire who ranks higher than that of the dead."
That's right. It's Rank IX, Ancestor.
It's called Twenty-Seven Ancestors because there are twenty-seven of them in existence.
<Page17>
"It was usually back and forth, but Rank VII will be 'Greater Dead Apostles'
those on Rank VI are recognized by the Ancestors and given further abilities. Even with the same name, their scale is different from that of the Rank VI."
<Page18>
"Being on this rank is like a poison that pollutes the area.
It's a heresy that average executors cannot match with.
A vampire who is allowed to do things by their own will as an aristocrat."
".....? Own will, in other words?"
<Page19>
"They're not a slave.
The Greater Dead Apostles aren't completely obedient to their parent Ancestors. In fact, they can even go against them."
<Page20>
"If the conditions are right, the Greater Dead Apostles can even defeat their parents and inherit their curse.
Well, it's almost impossible to beat the Ancestors. Even if they share the same 'freedom', the years that the ancestors have lived are enormous. It'll be difficult for a Greater Dead Apostle to exceed their Ancestors' Lifescale.
<Page21>
"That's why if you want to inherit your Ancestor's curse, Rank VIII, Successor.
They are said to be a talented vampire that was recognized by their Ancestor.
In other words, they're prince or princess.
Some of the Ancestors suddenly brought someone up to this rank when they see something that is not a vampire."
<Page22>
"Princess?...# in other words, someone like you?"
If I recalled correctly. She said she was royalty as well, this Arcueid.
<Page23>
""Hmm, maybe there are some out there, the dead that are made to have similar characteristics to mine.""
<Page24>
"Assuming that there are at least two rank VIII's per Ancestor, there are easily over 50 of them. There must have been some ancestors who tried to do so.
Well, they and I are fundamentally different, so no matter how far they go, they're just counterfeit products ."
<Page25>
"But I won't deny that Rank VII Vampires are definitely strong.
That's right. Basically speaking, they are surely stronger than Vlov."
"――――――"
Someone who surpasses that <vampire|V l o v>.....?
There are at least 50 of such monsters.....?
<Page26>
"See. I knew it.
Your blood is boiling because you want to kill somebody, Mr. Killer?"
"Quit fussing around. This is what you call "fear", Ms Vampire."
<Page27>
I reply on a human scale.
Now that I have decided to cooperate, I would like to make one thing clear. I can't do what humans can't.
<Page28>
"Now, it's finally the main subject. the 'Rank IX'.
These Twenty-Seven Ancestors are the pinnacle of the dead, right?"
<Page29>
"That's right. An old Dead Apostle who escaped from the position of emergency food and won independence as a completely different thing.
A crimson stain that fell from the moon to the ground.
Deadly poisons with a world that is never compatible with others.
The ones who brought forth the birth of rank VI vampires, and devour humans as 'lifespan'."
<Page30>
"It was them, the one who created this vampire society structure that has existed until now.
Although the scale of existence varies from individual to individual.
'Elders' are those who are active since before the Christian era,
and 'Upstarts' are those who have been active after the Christian era.
<Page31>
"For example, Vlov. He is an 'upstart' who climbed to Rank IX from Rank VI in the last century by... killing his parent and became the new Ancestor."
<Page32>
On the Vampire scale, Vlov is just a Dead Apostle who just became an Ancestor recently.
That's why he appeared in this city, and caused such problems without regards for tradition or style, says Arcueid.
<Page33>
That's fine, The rules of the vampire have nothing to do with me.
What's worrisome is that strange ability.
A curse that repaints the world into a frigid cold just by being present.
And flames that are scattered just to withstand the cold.
They are no longer what 'human-shaped things' are allowed to have.
<Page34>
"I can't understand....
No matter how long they've lived, the dead are just an extension of humans, aren't they. Humans can't do such things no matter how many years they've lived.
Then maybe there's something else about it?"
<Page35>
"Yes. In fact, it doesn't matter how many years they've lived to become an Ancestor.
The quality of their blood is what makes them Ancestors."
<Page36>
"The commandments of Oomoto that have been engraved in their soul.
The truth they have been crowned with, the worldview that makes up the foundation of their thirst.
A singularity that rewrites the physical laws of the planet just by circulating its blood.
Principle Blood Command―――Idea Blood."
<Page37>
"<Principle Blood Commandment|Idea Blood>―――"
That is.
The bottomless 'hole' that is in his innermost part?
<Page38>
"Well, you can say that it's a 'crown'.
The dead who inherits this blood will become an Ancestor no matter what rank they're in.
However, there's a millennial-class foundation that runs the Principle Blood Commandment. Even if a dead who has been active for hundreds of years inherits it, they will just simply be crushed by the curse."
"Just like Vlov?"
<Page39>
"That's right. Now that I think about it, he seems to have endured it properly.
... I wonder why his ego remained so much even though he was a Rank VI Apostle."
<Page40>
"Well, I know now that they're quite problematic.
By some mistake, he came to our city and we took care of him.
I don't want to think about it too much, but does this upset other ancestors?"
<Page41>
"Ah, that's fine. The Twenty-Seven Ancestors are enemies, basically speaking.
None of them will care if Vlov has disappeared in this island country."
<Page42>
"So there should be no retaliation from them, right?"
"Yes. Only a few of them are in cooperative relationships.
As long as we don't mess with the old five... Alliance of the Gods.
However, not all of them are enemies of mankind, and some of them have already been defeated."
<Page43>
"'Twenty-Seven Ancestors' is a designation that indicates their kind, so it shouldn't be changed, but in reality it's, uh...  twenty-one ancestors?
Vlov inherited the principle of Offenbaum.
The principle of 'fruitfulness', the# principle of 'castle, kingdom',
Principle of 'sword',
And the principle of 'melting' which has been sealed by the church,
Principle of 'limb'..."
<Page44>
"These are the only ones that were eliminated in past three thousand years.
The church had to prepare over a century in order to seal one Ancestor, but there are only two successful cases of this.
So? Do you now understand how amazing a feat it was to eliminate Vlov?"
<Page45>
"Well, it's mostly thanks to you.
Whether it's amazing or not, I'm keenly aware that I don't want to do it again."
"You can rest assured. Because there are no more Twenty-Seven Ancestors in this country anymore."
<Page46>
That's good.
Rather, I don't want a monster that can repel a century of planning from an organiztion to come after me.
Isn't that when the JSDF come in?
