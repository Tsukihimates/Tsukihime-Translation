As soon as the lunchtime came around,、#Arihiko Inui, the "useless human" appeared saying 'I just woke up!' with a yawn.
<Page2>
"Wowsie, I slept well.
Let's eat lunch, Tohno. Let's eat."
<Page3>
Here it is. I hypothesize that there are only three major needs in that skull.
<Page4>
"I'm going to have lunch with Senpai. Isn't having lunch with Senpai your boom?"
"What? Lunch with senpai?"
<Page5>
Arihiko frowned as if he had bitten a bitter worm.
Apparently, he was rejected by Senpai again today.
<Page6>
I have lunch with Arihiko.
Arihiko, who had slept a lot in the infirmary.
"Search for "Souya Station"...... Hmm, nothing new there."
He was busy gathering information with his phone in hand.
He says, "It's a fatal wound to be four hours behind the world".
<Page7>
He could be considered an Internet addict, but his case is different from other students.
For Arihiko, <information|news> about the area around Soya Station is not just a personal pastime. It's a serious tool for survival in the downtown area at night, so to speak, and he's always checking to see what his weapon of choice is.
<Page8>
"Another robbery at a convenience store.
The clerk was stabbed in the abdomen with a knife and seriously injured, and the perpetrator is an alcoholic. Wow, that looks painful. Drunk people don't know what to do... I guess mail order is the only way to shop."
<Page9>
Arihiko ate his set meal while operating his cell phone with one hand.
This is how the culture of fathers reading the newspaper at mealtime is being replaced by the latest thing.
No, I do not care about such modern criticism.
<Page10>
"Arihiko, do you enjoy reading that kind of news at mealtime?"
"No, it's not fun. I don't enjoy it, but I have to show my dumb friend who has no interest in the world what's going on in the world.
Tohno-kun, are you listening to me? The north exit is collapsing, drunks are stabbing people, and there are street thugs killing randoms."
<Page11>
"That's for sure. But the killing incidents won't happen anymore.
We can't do anything about the accident at the north exit, but other than that, it's business as usual, right?"
<Page12>
"Really?　Have they caught the killer?"
"No, I don't think they caught him, but..."
<Page13>
The killer is no longer in this world.
That's why modern-day vampires are never in the news, and no one is ever killed for no reason.
<Page14>
"Anyway, it means there won't be any more incidents like that, no more casualties. The city is back to normal."
"............ Mmm. But I'm sure there will be more casualties, Tohno."
<Page15>
"I don't get it. How can you be so sure, Arihiko?"
"Because, look. It's on the news now that the ninth body was found this morning."
<Page16>
Arihiko shows me the screen of his mobile phone.
<Page17>
"―――――、#h."
I couldn't believe my eyes.
The site that collects the latest news did indeed have new information on the bloodsucking murder case, starting with an overhead photo of the north exit of Souya Station.
<Page18>
" Seriously, Isn't this the back of the movie theater we always go to?"
"Wait. Let me see it again."
<Page19>
I borrowed a cell phone from Arihiko.
It wasn't amateur demagoguery, nor was it a hypothesis based on speculation.
The screen clearly showed the official statement from the police that there had been a ninth victim of a street murder last night.
<Page20>
"No way..."
It was too much for me to handle.
He's... Vlov is dead. I killed him with my own hands.
But why would there be a new corpse that has so much blood drained from it......!?
<Page21>
"Modern-day vampires, huh? #I don't mind being sucked if the other person is a beautiful woman."
"...Beautiful, vampire?"
<Page22>
A chill runs down my spine at Arihiko's lighthearted comment.
"If you're a beautiful woman, you can suck me off."
That nonsense is not a joke for me.
<Page23>
"The case is not over yet..."
The new victims show that the vampires are alive and well.
You can do a simple process of elimination at .......
Vlov is gone.
So, the other vampire that remains is...
