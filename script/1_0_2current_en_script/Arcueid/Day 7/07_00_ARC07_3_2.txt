I don't feel sleepy yet, but it seems that my body needs some rest.
A lot has happened today in any case.
Besides, one could say that I've been dragged around by her this entire evening.
<Page2>
"...You're right. I should definitely get going."
"I suppose so. You are tired after all, #not to mention that scary little sister of yours."
"No, she's not scary at all."
<Page3>
I was only delaying the inevitable.
But besides that...
<Page4>
"So what's the plan for tomorrow? Where do you want to meet?"
"We can meet here. At 10PM exact. Don't forget to bring your knife with you."
<Page5>
She didn't have to remind me that.
As if I would go around searching for vampires empty-handed.
<Page6>
"But 10PM huh..."
The mansion turns off the lights at 9:30 and bans anyone from entering and leaving at 10.
It will be hard to go out behind Hisui's and Kohaku's backs.
I almost suggest pushing the time forward to 11PM, but then decided against it, telling myself 'Whatever'.
<Page7>
After all, the night is shorter than it seems.
The more time we have searching together, the better.
<Page8>
"That's great. Okay then, Shiki.
I'll see you here again tomorrow."
<Page9>
"――――――"
What a troublemaker she's been today.
The white vampire says goodbye in the most gentle tone and leaves.
<Page10>
"...What the hell. So you can do it after all."
I continue to complain as if to overlook the feelings that welled up in my heart.
...Damnit.
I don't think I can forget our promise if she gives me a smile like that.
