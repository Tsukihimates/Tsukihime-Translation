I'll talk with Arcueid for a little longer.
Even though I've decided to help exterminate vampires, there are many things I still don't know. 
<Page2>
"No, I still feel nauseous, so I'll stay here until it gets better. Until then, there are still some things I want to ask you.
Walking around the city may not be an option, but I should at least be able to do this, right?"
<Page3>
"I-I guess? I don't mind it personally, but is that really okay with you?
Don't humans usually get sleepy at this time of night?"
"It's no big deal. I was never good at sleeping in the first place."
<Page4>
"Not good... as in insomnia?"
"No, I can sleep. I just don't like doing it."
"Hmm. Do you not see any dreams?"
<Page5>
Dreams...?
...No. #I don't understand something as vague as that#.
<Page6>
"Anyways, let's hang around until midnight.
Although I can leave if you're getting tired of all this talking."
<Page7>
"No, I'm not tired at all!
Rather I'll happily accept your request!"
<Page8>
"...I-I see. I respect your enthusiasm, but please restrain that explosive energy of yours. No punching the ground or anything like that."
<Page9>
"I wouldn't do something as meaningless as that.
Geez, what kind of person do you take me for?! Are you misunderstanding something again?!"
"Don't worry, I know exactly who you are. You're a vampire who goes too far and doesn't know how to hold back."
<Page10>
Now then, without further ado, I should throw some questions her way.
The thing that needed to be asked is―――
C:>...More details regarding vampires.
C:>...What are the Twenty-Seven Ancestors?
C:>...About those clothes she wore when fighting Vlov.
