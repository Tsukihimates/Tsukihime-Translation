<Page1>
 By the time I'm released from the handshake... or rather, a one-sided grab from Arcueid, it's already approaching nine in the evening. 
<Page2>
 My head hurts when I think about what I'm going to do when I get home, but now that I've decided to help, I still can't leave tonight.
 The vampire extermination will start over again from here.
<Page3>
"......So, what are we going to do now?
 Are we still going to walk the streets and look for the dead?"
<Page4>
"That's right. If we wipe out all the dead in this city, the parent vampire will be forced to come out.
 That's all we can do for now, though..."
"Is that okay?" Arcueid asks with a glance.
<Page5>
"I don't care, I'm just going along with Arcueid. Everyone knows their own business best, so I'll defer to the expert." //This is the literal TL of "もちはもち屋", we could go for an alternate metaphor as well.
<Page6>
 ...Then.
This time, Arcueid watches me with a smirk on her face.
<Page7>
"What now? Did I say something funny?"
"Yes. Shiki, you're being so honest."
"........"
 ...I'll be more abrasive from now on.
 I have a feeling that if I let her get the better of me, she's going to make some more outrageous demands.
<Page8>
"Let's go. We can look around the city, right? Do you want to check under the elevated train tracks again?"
<Page9>
"No, we're done with that area.
　The dead don't eat together, and they have their own territories so that they don't concentrate the number of victims in one section.
　There's a limit to the number of dead that can go eat per night. I was going to stop for tonight, but... now that Shiki is here, let's explore some more."
<Page10>
"...To avoid conflicts, huh... It's a full-fledged control structure. I thought they would be more indiscriminate."
<Page11>
"For the parent vampire, collecting blood is not a pastime, it's a necessary task for survival, a job. Routine work is the right word for it."
<Page12>
"Valuable labor, huh? But, that doesn't mean they're not going to do something about it.
 Since Arcueid is shrinking their group, they can either increase their numbers to compensate or just retract the dead and disappear..."
<Page13>
"Basically, vampires are individuals who are "reluctant to go out". 
 Yet, as a vampire, they can't survive without extracting bodily fluids from others.
 Even if they know that I'm targeting their base, they have no choice but to kill in order to get the minimum amount of food required."
<Page14>
 ...I get it now.
 Arcueid has been going after the enemy's rations, as it were. 
<Page15>
 It's difficult to find the parent sleeping somewhere in this city.
 So, instead of searching for them, we smoke them out.
 The parent, cut off from the source of labor and sustenance they need to survive, will finally be forced to act on their own.
<Page16>
 And once they start moving, Arcueid can sense the vampire's presence.
 ...This is where vampire extermination comes into play.
 We can destroy the source of this incident head-on, just like when we killed Vlov.
<Page17>
"I understand the situation. Anyway, I guess we'll just have to walk around the city at night and find the deads that are still active."
<Page18>
"Right. So, Shiki. I'd like you to take off your glasses and follow me, okay?"
"Take off my glasses... why?"
<Page19>
"It's more effective that way.
 I can sense the presence of humans and non-humans.
 You can read the difference between the living and the dead as visual information.
 The more ways we can search for enemies, the better, right?"
<Page20>
"―――――"
 ...Arcueid's explanation makes sense.
 I said I would help, and I have no reason to refuse.
 But to take off my glasses and act―
<Page21>
"It's going to be very hard on your body.
 Still, it's a good opportunity, so let me say it one more time.
 If you think you'll be okay, take off your glasses and follow me."
<Page22>
 ...Walking around the city with my glasses off, huh?
 I've never tried to do that in the seven years I've had these glasses.
<Page23>
 In the first place, just looking at things gives me a headache, and it's easy to imagine what would happen if I walked around town in that state.
 So, of course―――
<Page24>
"..........."
 ...It's okay, it's just a headache.
 Compared to Arcueid, who's enduring so much pain, this isn't a big deal.
<Page25>
"Fine, I'll take off my glasses and follow you.
 If that'll put an end to this, it's a small price to pay."
<Page26>
"――――Sure. Let's go, then."
 I take one deep breath, pull off my glasses, and start walking towards the city.
<Page27>
 I walk shoulder to shoulder with Arcueid through the crowds.
 I haven't been through a landscape full of lines like this since I was in the hospital.
<Page28>
"――――"
 I'm not dizzy at the moment.
 I don't get headaches just by looking at objects.
 However, I feel sick whenever I see a "line" on a human walking down the street instead of a thin line on a building.
<Page29>
 ...... I can't help but feel disgusted.
 It's not that "people with lines all over their bodies" are creepy.
 It's just... being reminded that human could die so easily makes me want to throw up.
<Page30>
 Walking through the city at night.
 Arcueid doesn't say a word, but continues on her way without hesitation, as if she has a destination in mind.
<Page31>
　We spent about two hours going around the main places in front of the station.
　In the end, I couldn't find a single person with an unusual "line."
<Page32>
"Shiki, you can put your glasses back on now.
 After all, it seems that there are no more dead tonight."
<Page33>
 I put on my glasses#.
 I pat my chest in relief as my vision returns to normal.
<Page34>
"Can we just give up on them so easily?　We've only been around the city once."
<Page35>
"No, one look around is enough. Their presence tends to linger for a while, but there was no sign of the dead anywhere in the city.
 Maybe the last of the food-collecting dead was the one from earlier. From here, we'll go on to crush the dead one step higher."
<Page36>
"......You look grumpy, Arcueid."
"Of course I am. Even though you're here, I'm totally striking out. Hmmmph. I was trying to show off my good side."
<Page37>
"―――――"
 ...
　It's kind of embarassing for her to be in a bad mood for that reason.
<Page38>
"I, I don't care if it's a waste of time... If you're so displeased, feel free to go around town again.
 I'll focus my attention on it this time. Maybe you'll find something."
<Page39>
"No way. We're done for tonight, I can't let you attempt something so unreasonable."
"? Unreasonable? Are you saying I'm exhausted...?"
<Page40>
"It's because I know. You don't even realize it. You look so pale, even now. Come on, sit down on the bench. It'll make you feel a little better, won't it?"
<Page41>
"Come on, come on," she says as she pushes me onto the bench.
 Well, to be honest, I was one step away from throwing up, so I'll sit down and...
<Page42>
"Ah......."
 I was so comfortable that my voice leaked out.
 Sitting down released the tension, or perhaps the accumulated fatigue came out all at once... The fact that I felt good even though my shoulders were heavier was proof that I was pushing myself too hard.
<Page43>
"...Thanks, that helps.
 Although, this is a minor headache compared to the other ones I've had. It's not nearly as dangerous as the dizziness that threatens my consciousness."
<Page44>
　I take a deep breath and rest for a while, and the nausea goes away.
　It's nothing compared to Arcueid's wound.
　So don't worry about it―――#Arcueid?
<Page45>
"A weak creature like you shouldn't push yourself too hard.
 If you don't faint, it's fine?　You're wrong. Your eyes are neither light nor heavy. //This is literally correct, but I think some kind of change might make it read better in English.
 Don't try to see what you can't make out very well. You'll cripple your brain if you strain it too much."
"...? Crippled by whom?"
<Page46>
"By yourself! Why do you have no sense of danger!?
 You're a pacifist with such a rare magical eye, and you're nothing but a tasty prey!　I don't know how you've managed to survive all this time, but I could just snatch you up and eat you, normally!"
<Page47>
 ......Surviving is normal for any country.
 I mean, please don't underestimate one of the most law-abiding countries in the world. Even if some people say it isn't peaceful, it's really amazing that we can maintain such a high level of security, you know?
<Page48>
"......Okay. I didn't want to say too much, but I'll explain it to you."
<Page49>
"Alright? You know how you said that it's easy to see the death of living things, but hard to see the death of minerals?
 That's because, in the end, it's a matter of your brain's circuitry.
 The death of things. Seeing the cause and effect is actually more like reading it, not seeing it.
<Page50>
"The basis of all things is an origin, a single absolute. //This is the beginning of lore about the Root, so it should probably be carefully checked by a JP speaker. I've grabbed terms I recognized off the TM wiki. 
 It is the beginning and the end of the universe.
 It is "something that records everything." It can't be called information because it isn't just some document, it simply "is". It doesn't have a will of its own, and it can't have a direction. It is the Swirl of the Root, from which all causes flow."
<Page51>
"Everything in the <universe|world> has flown from that swirl, evolved from it, and ended up in its current form. You, me, vampires, and humans are all just atoms that started there.
 ...It's too far away, and much too complicated to trace a path back to the beginning, but you still know that a "one" exists, right?"
<Page52>
"However, no matter how far we are from the original source, as long as we are derived from it, we are connected by a very thin thread."
<Page53>
"The root of all, a record of the beginning and end of everything.
 Anything connected to it should "be aware of" the end of things.
 The brain of a higher-order life form is capable of receiving and transmitting, but in most humans, that connection line is limited only to themselves. However, there are some people whose circuits are potentially open. People who don't use any kind of magic circuit, who aren't even a higher species, but are capable of supernatural feats.
<Page54>
"This type of person is classified by the mages as psychics. 
 They are mutants who were born with some sort of magic circuit, despite being human.
 ---For example, a person who can see the death of things without having learned any mysteries."
<Page55>
"――――――"
 ...No, I'm sorry, Arcueid.
 It's a great story, but the important thing is that my brain hasn't kept up with it at all.
<Page56>
"You don't have to understand, Shiki.
 What I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't try to see things that are too difficult to see.
 I can't say for sure because I can't see them, but I think the line isn't the only thing you see. You can see not only the line, but also the point, the origin of that line.
"―――――"
<Page57>
　...She's absolutely right.
　Sometimes it seems like there are only lines, but if I look hard enough, I can see points. In fact, at the last moment with Vlov, there was a point in the center of a huge whirlpool.
<Page58>
 In retrospect, it wasn't just with Vlov.
 Most of the time I would lose consciousness from phantom pains that would slash at my brain stem, but there was definitely a point.
<Page59>
"...Yes. #When I killed you, I could see the points. There were several of them, and the lines were flowing, connecting them."
<Page60>
　To use a metaphor, it's like a blood vessel.
 If a line is a blood vessel, then a point is something that produces that blood vessel.
<Page61>
"So it's "lines where things die easily" and the actual "point of death"... What is that, I wonder.
 ......I think you could even see the death of minerals if you wanted to. But in order to do so, your brain would have to open a line from the biological category to the mineral category and try to see the death of the mineral.
 It's an impossible exercise. Your brain would overload and you would definitely become useless."
<Page62>
 ...Would become useless, huh?
"Does that mean my eyes will stop seeing death?"
<Page63>
"Not at all. Hey, Shiki, what happens to an engine that's been recklessly overblown?"
"It'll be junk. Once an engine has seized, it can never be used again―――"
<Page64>
　Oh, that's right.
　In other words, the headache from watching death was like a screaming engine that was going too fast.
<Page65>
"Do you understand?　If you're just seeing things, there's no problem, but don't try to see things you can't see.
 At best, your blood vessels will burst and your brain will be overloaded. If you go beyond that, you might end up turning into stone while still alive."
<Page66>
"You should be grateful to the mage who made you those glasses. //Are we going to use majutsushi based on the circumstances? I will change it into mage for now
　Most psychics use their powers without realizing how dangerous they are and end up crippling themselves.
　...Although, for a human being who's an existential misfit that can't live in normal society, maybe they'd be happier that way."
<Page67>
"―――――"
"And apparently, that's why I'm here.
　　 I'm going to get you back to the life you had before."
<Page68>
 That's what Sensei said, and she made these glasses for me.
 ...There are so many things to be thankful for that it makes my heart hurt.
 In so many ways, that woman saved the Tohno Shiki of today on that day seven years ago.
<Page69>
"By the way..."
"UWAH!?"
<Page70>
　While I was busy being deeply moved, Arcueid peered into my face from right beside me.
　It's bad for my heart.
　After a good story, she should at least be a little more careful.
<Page71>
"What now? I'm not giving you my glasses."
"That's not what I'm trying to do.
 What should we do now?　I don't think the deads are going to show up again. Shall we say goodbye for tonight?"
<Page72>
"............"
 It was eleven in the evening.
 The curfew at the Tohno residence has long since been broken.
 I'm―――
C:>Going to talk to Arcueid some more.
C:>...No, I should get home soon.
