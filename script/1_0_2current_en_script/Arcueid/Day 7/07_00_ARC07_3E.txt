Arcueid walks through the darkening city.
Without hesitation, a white shadow with golden hair fluttering in the wind.
The figure is the same one I saw the first time.
Or, maybe it's the same figure that confronted Vlov in the collapsed rubble.
<Page2>
...The buoyant feeling I had is fading away.
There's no doubt about it. That's the way a hunter acts.
<Page3>
"Arcueid."
"------"
Arcueid walks away without looking back at me.
<Page4>
"Listen to me. Where do you think you're going?"
"-----"
<Page5>
The girl in white will not stop walking.
...It's pathetic to back down here.
It's pathetic, but I decide to follow her in silence for now.
<Page6>
Click-clack, click-clack.
We continue our walk in silence, with only the sound of our footsteps.
---And.
With a snap, Arcueid stops and turns around.
<Page7>
"Don't follow me. Can't you see how annoying it is to have a normal human like you around?"
<Page8>
"I'm sorry I'm human. Tell me what you're doing and I'll leave."
"...It's none of your business, so leave me alone."
<Page9>
With a "Hmph," Alcade turns and begins to walk away.
...Oh, man.
It looks like the silent wandering will begin again.
<Page10>
When we reach the bottom of an elevated railway line, away from the downtown area and less populated, Arcueid stops dead in her tracks.
<Page11>
"I found it."
"Eh...?"
Arcueid's voice is cold, like a different person.
<Page12>
"-----Tch."
...A shiver runs down my spine.
I can clearly feel how hostile Arcueid is even while she's turned away.
<Page13>
"---What---"
I can't say what she'll do.
I know exactly what she's going to do, so I don't need to say it.
The only thing radiating from Arcueid is her unadulterated "murderous intent."
<Page14>
"Hey- what are you doing...?!"
"-----"
Arcueid doesn't answer.
In the direction of her gaze, there is a nondescript man in a suit walking by.
<Page15>
"Shiki. Take off your glasses and look at that person."
"By that person, ... do you mean the man in front of us?"
<Page16>
"Hurry.
If you want to know what I'm doing, you can ask me later."
"...I don't really want to do this on the street, but---"
<Page17>
I remove my glasses.
"...Ugh."
I have a slight headache at my temples.
In exchange for the pain, I can vaguely see "lines" on the ground and walls.
<Page18>
"Just so we're clear. Do you see your lines more clearly in living things?
"...Yeah. They look more solid that way."
<Page19>
"I'm sure they do. You cannot understand the death of minerals because you are a living being. //Probably a better word than "minerals," but that is the term Nasu uses.
You can see the "result" as their physical breakdown, but you cannot see the true "end" of a mineral. In order to do so, you would need to have the same perspective and the same set of values as they do.
...To be able to "see" death, you have to "understand" life."
<Page20>
"And while we're at it, how does that person look to you?"
"---?"
I don't think he's any different than anyone else-
<Page21>
"----!?"
I involuntarily step back.
<Page22>
...What, is that?
It's true that every human being has "lines."
Yet, they are countable, and they form geometric patterns that flow smoothly.
<Page23>
And yet- what is that?
There are "lines" running all over his body. I can't even see what the man looks like because of the "lines" that cover him like blood veins.
<Page24>
"---Guh."
I feel like I'm going to throw up.
...It's the opposite with that thing. It's not a human with lines of death, it's lines of death in the shape of a human.
<Page25>
"How does that thing look to you?　You know, I wish you would see me more like a normal human being now."
<Page26>
"......Tch."
I can't respond to Arcueid's words.
It's all I can do to hold back the nausea for now.
<Page27>
"---Yeah.
How disappointing, I can't believe you saw death in that thing as well."
"Ah... It's not normal, it's different, but... I, can see, the lines..."
<Page28>
"I knew it. You can even kill the dead, can't you?
It doesn't even matter if they're alive or not. You can stop anything that moves, anything that can be destroyed, without exception--- what's with that? Are you sure you're not the real monster?" //The last sentence here might be wrong
"Eh---"
<Page29>
"As you can see, it can't be called a human anymore.
It's a vampire that uses the blood of others to cover its debt of death."
<Page30>
Arcueid quickens her pace.
In a straight line, towards the man who seemed to be everywhere.
<Page31>
"Hey, Arcueid-"
"Shiki, stay over there."
<Page32>
The man must have noticed Arcueid, because he disappears from my sight in an instant.
In fact, he leapt from the scene with inhuman speed.
<Page33>
The man runs away into the darkness under the elevated train tracks to hide himself.
Arcueid is already gone.
Lit only by a rusty electric lamp, she too dashes into the darkness, out of my sight.
<Page34>
-Thump.
I heard the sound of a heartbeat very close to me.
<Page35>
The night is not yet late.
The headlights of cars passing by.
The sound of a train speeding overhead.
Even though I am in the middle of all this noise, I can't feel the presence of anyone but myself.
<Page36>
-Thump.
Glasses--- I have to put my glasses back on soon.
If I don't, I'll see something unpleasant.
Otherwise, I'm going to see an abyss where previously I've only seen the doorway.
<Page37>
-Thump.
But I can't move my body.
My naked eyes that see the world full of splintered lines are staring through the darkness at the black hole that Arcueid entered, as if mesmerized.
<Page38>
"----"
Suddenly, the sound disappears.
The sound of the wind.
The smell of the earth.
Everything is frozen in place.
<Page39>
----Gi  //Translation checker, please verify the first line on page 39, 40, and 41. Not sure if these are sound effects or partial words. 
Under the moon at absolute zero.
Just out of sight, I hear a alien sound.
<Page40>
----Go
I can't see it,
and I don't hear anything.
<Page41>
----Com, plete
And yet, I can see it.
My eyes confirm the sound of death colliding with death.
<Page42>
"Guh---"
My vision is red.
I'm not sure how I'm viewing the "death" of something I'm not able to see.
<Page43>
"----"
Glasses.
If I don't wear them, I'll lose my mind.
I put my glasses back on with shaking hands, fighting back the urge to vomit that rose up in my throat.
<Page44>
Sound and light return.
Looking around with a clear mind, there is nothing unusual under the elevated tracks.
<Page45>
Although there were no people and few cars, this was still a "normal" city at night.
There is no danger, there should be no danger, this is a civilized area inhabited by humans.
<Page46>
"Ha- Ha- Ha-"
I can't breathe well.
Even with my glasses on, I feel as if the "death" from earlier is still lingering in the corner of my vision.
<Page47>
"Ar...cueid...?"
Arcueid comes out of the darkness, even more breathless and sluggish than I am.
<Page48>
"Shiki...?　I see, you're still here."
Turning her face away awkwardly, Arcueid wavers, slipping past me.
Her gait is as weak as a sick person's.
<Page49>
---To be honest, my nausea hasn't gone away either.
But I don't care about that when I see Arcueid in such pain.
<Page50>
"Wait, what's wrong with you...?!"
I grab Arcueid by the shoulders as she tries to walk away.
She slowly turns around, her eyes vacant.
<Page51>
"I'm fine. I'm just a little tired, don't mind me.
---This has nothing to do with you at all."
<Page52>
"Idiot, if you're tired, get some rest...!
You're sweating like crazy, and by the looks of it, you're seriously injured...!"
"Hah," I exhale, struggling to catch my breath, and grab Arcueid's arm.
<Page53>
"...What? Shiki, you look like you're about to collapse."
"I'm just anemic, that's all.
If you have time to worry about others, worry about your own body."
<Page54>
"It's okay. It's no use worrying about it anyway."
Arcueid's breathing was really, sadly weak.
<Page55>
"What on Earth--- I didn't think you still had that scar---"
I never asked her if it already healed.
It's a wound that was made by protecting me.
<Page56>
"----"
Arcueid remains downcast and doesn't answer.
That's an affirmation, not denial... I think.
<Page57>
"Oh, come on, how many times do I have to tell you, you idiot?
Can't you be mature with a body like that!?"
"...Hmph. It's alright, I'm trying to be."
"You aren't at all!　Just because you're not human doesn't mean you can go out injured...!"
<Page58>
I found myself seriously angry and painfully aware of it.
...I can't leave her alone.
I can't leave this inexplicably troublesome woman alone.
<Page59>
"...What are you really doing here?
Hey, don't be quiet, answer me. I'm not leaving you until you tell me!"
<Page60>
I grab her by both white shoulders.
Arcueid looks down and seems to nod faintly.
<Page61>
"...Jeez. You're rather persistent, aren't you?
Okay then, let's change locations. It looks like the last one was a bad idea anyway."
<Page62>
Arcueid waves my arm away and turns on her heel.
It seems that the destination is not the downtown area, but an uninhabited park.
