...... After all, knowledge about vampires is necessary. //Jesus Christ.
Parent vampires and the dead servants. //I wish the translator good luck.
Let's hear about their relationships in details. //In nomine Patris et Filii, et Spiritus Sanсti
<Page2>
"Hmmmm. Don't just be quiet there, follow me, okay."
"I'm sorry for being quiet. The one who is going to explain everything from the basic is you."
<Page3>
"Oh, as expected of the primates who build the pyramid using only human power! Solid and sincere.
Okay, so for tonight let's talk about the intermediate vampire course, how the vampire society works!"
<Page4>
...... I don't really want to know much about it, but the one who requested it was me.
Let's quietly listen to professor Arcueid here.
<Page5>
"That being said. it's excessive to talk from the beginning... So I'll only talk about our enemies, the dead ancestors.
Most of them are old fashioned vampires, and their reproduction... The way they multiply is to suck blood and increase their companions.
Do I really need to explain this anymore?"
<Page6>
"Aa. The lord and their servant.
―――One ruler and many worker ants was it?"
<Page7>
"Yes. There are many types of worker ants.
As I said before, this is like a staircase.
<Page8>
"First, Level Ⅰ, The Corpse.
A puppet that cannot stand on its own and moves according to the instructions of its parents. If there is no order, it will be left as a corpse and die.
A low ranking soldier for short. They just sucked blood and sent blood. One of which we call the dead."
<Page9>
"Next, Ⅱ level, The Ghoul.
A dead person who has a will but can't think clearly and mimicking the form they had when alive.
Although they don't decompose due to their parent's magical power, their insides have completely collapsed.
And since their brain is rotten, they instinctively seek blood and flesh, so they are more ferocious than the "corpse" on the first level. If I dare to say it, it would be a soldier. But then this is also a dead."
<Page10>
"Ⅲ level, The Undead.
I wonder if they can finally be called a vampire from here on.
A living corpse. Undead. Although they don't have the thinking ability like normal beings, they can disguise as a human by themselves.
A senior soldier who died and had their brain reconstructed. They can stand the sunlight too. However, antiseptic/preservative treatment must be done carefully, or their identity will be revealed easily.
This is the end of the category called the dead"
<Page11>
...So that's it.
That zombie ... Did the dead have such a stage?
The higher the steps go, the more the corpse improves from just a corpse to a moving corpse.
By the way,
<Page12>
"Nevermind the ranks, who named the dead and the corpse? You?"
<Page13>
"Sorry to dissappoint you, But this is usually the job of the holy church. We're just using them since they're convenient, and they have become a common word in the mage's world.
The problem is who was the one inside the church that spreaded this. But well, it doesn't matter"
<Page14>
"Next is the Ⅳ level, Nightkin.
An immortal who acts as a vampire apprentice while maintaining his personality
Instead of having physical abilities that are far exceed humans, he feels extreme coldness and thirst. So to speak, a low-ranking knight, a half-serving vampire."
<Page15>
"Victims start with vampires on this level since things above level Ⅵ carefully suck their prey little by little. It becomes anemic when exposed to sunlight, but isn't burned.
In the magical world, it is only up to this level that one can still be called 'human'"
<Page16>
"Vampire apprentice ... In other words, it's not "dead" anymore?"
"Yes, A vampire who has reached the IV level can live even if they are away from their parent. From the perspective of the parent, it seems like it's changed from a thing to a living thing.
Only one in a thousand people can become a level IV"
<Page17>
"Next is level V, Night Demon.
Four level deep into the rankings, the curse in the blood makes it possible to exert different abilities caused by the parent group or the individual.
Senior knight, a full-fledged vampire"
<Page18>
"And lastly, the Ⅵ level. Lesser Dead Appostle.
Completely independent as a "blood-sucking species". They can make children by sucking blood and eroding, but they can't make any children above this level.
It's the limit of the upstart. If I were to say it, it's a citadel.
The vampires nesting in this city are on this level. It ’s a disaster that makes a servant as a "parent" and preys on the village."
<Page19>
"The above is the identification system for the dead. Is there anything you need to know more?"
"Which level was Vlov?"
"Of course, VI, the Lesser Dead Appostle. In his case, I skipped to there, but that's for another time"
<Page20>
"Then another one. This is the main subject.
You said it was the social division system, but who decided it ... No, what decided it? If a vampire sucks blood and increases the number of companions, why are they different from each other?"
<Page21>
"You really did notice a good point.
That's the biggest drawback of the dead ... No, it's a feature.
Not everyone who is sucked by the dead apostle becomes a vampire, and the dead apostle doesn't make anyone a vampire."
<Page22>
"Making servants and eating are different
If it's just sucking blood, humans will die as humans.
However, at that time, when the blood of the dead blends in, the body of the human will be dominated and die. Afterwards, it would be reborn as a vampire and cursed.
This level represents the depth of the curse."
<Page23>
...... Then, the man just before wasn't revived after being killed ... # Was he killed by the "parent group" to make him a vampire from the beginning?"
<Page24>
"Yes. But it's not easy to make a servant. Vampires can't easily increase their families.
If you're a level one corpse, you can send blood after killing and make it a soldier.
However, in order to increase the number of level two vampires and above, the victims' own talents ... #Aptitude is needed."
<Page25>
"Aptitude...? What aptitude?"
"Immunity against the blood of blood-sucking species?"
<Page26>
"Most humans don't have the aptitude for it. Therefore, when the blood of a vampire is sent in, the body is easily dominated by the characteristics of the vampire. It’s like an illness that keeps you working after you die.
However that doesn't qualify as a good servant. As the parent, I'd be in trouble if I don't have my own strength. If you take time to move a worker ant every time, that will be the end, right?"
<Page27>
That's right. //Lord, have mercy. Kyrie, eléison.
Parent Vampires usually sleep in a coffin
Vampires who have lived for a long time have poor energy reserves. So it doesn't move often and requires limbs to collect <blood|energy> without having to do anything.
It'll be a different story if they consume their power every time they move their limbs.
<Page28>
"Humans with aptitude can resist the curse of the vampire.
After that, it's the capability of the person. Will they lose to the blood of a vampire and die, or will they overcome it and reborn as a vampire?
The corpses found in this city were humans who had aptitude but died as they were.
The results are just "killed" corpses left on the street. The dead will start moving on their own after being killed, but the bodies that couldn't be it, remain, right?"
<Page29>
"...I see. If you become that zombie, you won't have any bodies left."
"That kind of thing. The victims in the news are rather rare cases. They were noticed because they had the same aptitude, and as a result they died as humans."
<Page30>
"About one in a hundred people has aptitude. Among them, only those who can adapt to the foreign matter sent into the body can endure becoming vampires above the level 4.
Vampires are often said to have a hierachy, but not everyone can have a child by sending blood. Actually, the number of things that can be called "vampires" is decreasing over time."
<Page31>
"..."
It's not easy to grow a family. Arcueid said
For vampires, "subordinates" and "children" are probably be different.
The dead that Arcueid finished earlier was just nothing more that a "subordinate" who just moves.
<Page32>
"So, was the man killed a long time ago and worked as the vampire without even knowing it?"
<Page33>
"Even I don't know, It depends on the level.
Level one might be nothing more than a moving doll, but at level three, the brain is alive. They follow the Vampires, understand what they have become. They're willing to kill humans and send blood to their parents (I should probably put "or so" since it says "親基に血を送っているのよ".)
<Page34>
"...... No, that's not the case
It was killed suddenly, and when it realized it, it was already made into a moving corpse. That's why it's decided to follow" //in () are AE's stuffs
<Page35>
"...... I already said this before, the dead who begged for life was like that
'If you go against it, you will be killed', 'I was just ordered to do it'
In other words, they're killing humans because they don't want to die. What is the difference between this and being willing to kill yourself?"
<Page36>
"―――――― No, that is"
"The unconscious dead always complain that they have no freedom and that they have no choice but to do this. //wtf is this paragraph...
But the freedom to die against the Lord remains. But they chose to kill humans, so they're willing to kill their former relatives, Human Ikimono (its written in kana "イキモノ" so I'm not entirely sure about this one)."
<Page37>
"Well, in any case, I don't care because I'm going to kill all the things that are connected to the dead."
<Page38>
"..."
...... There are no words.
Arcueid's argument is correct. It makes sense.
But that's the vampire's ... strong creatures' reasoning.
Humans cannot live that well, nor can they live simply.
<Page39>
"And one more thing. Even servants can go againsts its parent.
Vampires that are called dead apostle gives their servants a free will. They want their servants to go against and defy them someday. Vlov is also a vampire who killed his parents and became a dead apostle."
<Page40>
"Well, remember this Shiki.
Vampires who are classified as dead apostle, love humans
No, I love human-like things. So they can be terrifying as much as they want. <Human|You> are the best on this planet ... because they are the only creatures that can consume humans' lives to afflict"
<Page41>
...... Human-like things, huh. Is it intelligence, or is it emotion?
Arcueid said.
Humans can't understand the death of minerals.
And similarly, minerals and animals can't understand human death.
Are emotional death and mental suffering an entertainment only applied for them?
<Page42>
"Do you mean they left behind freedom to suffer?
I can't understand. Why would vampires do that? It too wasteful. That hobby is too horrible"
<Page43>
"That's right. I admit it, that hobby of the vampires are horrible.
But that's only applies for the dead apostle. Those that were blood-sucking species from the beginning do not do that much"
"――――?"
What was a vampire from the beginning...?
<Page44>
"...... By the way, you said that there are two types of vampires.
Those who are vampires from the beginning and those who have become vampires from humans
Are those guys who "became vampire from humans" the dead apostles?"
<Page45>
"...... Well, that's right
Some have become immortal through magic, while others became a servant after being sucked by true ancestors."
<Page46>
".... Shiki, you said that its a bad hobby to use the human that was killed. But they're still better off. Because other dead apostle devise more despisable plays."
"Play- Do you mean that they kill humans by playing and use their corpses as a toy...?"
<Page47>
"...... I won't deny it
Entertainment is the same as breathing for the dead apostles
Despite not being short-lived like humans, being "bored" was their greatest enemy when they have attained immortality, albeit imperfectly.
Unlike us, they became immortal due to their meaningless habits, And they lose all their desires the moment they got immortality.
Since the purpose was immortality, it would be unavoidable to say that it can't be helped."
<Page48>
".....What's that. Don't say such things that you want to play because you're bored.
Generally speaking, if you don't get old and die. Then isn't that enough?. What other fun do you need."
<Page49>
"That's why it's already enough for them.
But that doesn't mean anything.
An intelligent body that recognizes itself as worthless --- a halted life loses its value there."
<Page50>
"They're afraid as they gradually wear out, so they're willing to make entertainment. Defend yourself that you are alive and that you still have fun. That is the beginning of the aristocrat"
<Page51>
"They started a game that imitated those of humans and expanded their power by making themselves look like a castle owner#.
It's a kingdom of the dead, to say the least. Unexpectedly, it seems to be exciting for them"
<Page52>
"I told you, didn't I? They're imitating humans.
The dead give their blood to the humans they sucked and killed for entertainment
The corpse grows through one in a thousand of chance, and eventually killing its parents and becoming a new dead apostle."
<Page53>
"A knight becomes a monarch with martial arts.
Eventually, they will bring down kings, --- they can't exist without such a game.
The lightness of the existence of devilish things, probably.
Even if it is immortal, it is no different from air if it has no meaning."
<Page54>
They look like idiots, Arcueid shrugs
Arcueid should be one of them, but she doesn't seem to have that kind of taste.
