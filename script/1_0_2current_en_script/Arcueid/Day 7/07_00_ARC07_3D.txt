"What did you want to talk about, Shiki?"
<Page2>
"Vampires. You said it before, didn't you? That the street murders happened recently were the works of vampires.
"Yes," Arcueid nods.
<Page3>
"So, did you hear on the news this morning that there was a new victim?
I heard that he was killed by a street thief last night, and his blood was drained."
"―――"
<Page4>
Arcueid's eyes narrow.
It was like stepping onto what you thought was the ground, only to realize it was thin ice, and the tension was so high that one wrong move could lead to death.
<Page5>
"Okay, so?"
"So... you."
<Page6>
I gulp down my spit.
Arcueid gazes straight at me.
It's a predator's gaze, one that will immediately pounce at even the slightest move.
<Page7>
"It's not funny, Arcueid.
Vlov is dead, so why was there still a vampire causing disturbance? I don't believe it, but you..."
If it's your hand that's doing the killing, I'd be-
<Page8>
"Huh. Well, it isn't me.
There must be some other vampire."
Relieving me of my nervousness, Arcueid seems surprised and replies immediately.
<Page9>
"―――"
I stifle an instinctive joy in my throat.
It was too early to be relieved.
It's good that it was another vampire, but there's still something that doesn't add up.
<Page10>
"So there were multiple vampires acting, one after another? Did a new vampire come along as soon as Vlov was gone?"
<Page11>
"Not at all. This incident has been the work of a single vampire from the beginning.
There was no 'new vampire' coming to prey on this city, and Vlov was unrelated to it."
...Vlov, was unrelated...?
<Page12>
"Unrelated... what do you mean by that?"
"It means exactly what I said. ...You're usually sharp, but you're still somewhat out of it, aren't you?"
<Page13>
"Okay? Yes, Vlov was a vampire, but did he suck human blood?"
"Of course he did. I mean, he was burning people all over the place-"
<Page14>
I, see.
Why didn't I notice such a simple difference?
The victims of the street murders were found as undamaged bodies after their blood had been drained.
<Page15>
However, Vlov was different.
He burned the bodies. He did drink blood, but that was not his primary method of killing.
<Page16>
In fact, the victims at the hotel were treated as casualties of the fire, not of homicide.
Then――― Vlov has no connection at all to the serial murders going on in the city...!
<Page17>
"Wait, wait, wait. What's with the bloodsucking murders, then?
Who the hell would do something like that?"
<Page18>
"The incident was the work of a different vampire than Vlov.
I came to this city to kill that vampire."
<Page19>
"The reason for Vlov's arrival is... well, it's become a little fuzzy.
I thought he was one of the people who came after me, but he didn't seem to have the... rationality to cooperate with a mortal society."
<Page20>
"Well, that's enough of that. Vlov is dead.
Anyway, Vlov and the vampire nesting in this city are not the same person. Vlov is truly an unrelated third party."
<Page21>
"I never told you my target was Vlov, did I?
Vlov was targeting me, but my only target is the bloodsucker known as the "street vampire" in this city.
...Shiki. I don't think it's possible, but did you have a very simple misunderstanding?"
<Page22>
"―――"
I gulp in astonishment.
But it's true, Arcueid is right.
<Page23>
When I heard that Arcueid's goal was to kill vampires, I completely misunderstood and thought that she was there to defeat Vlov.
<Page24>
"...What is it, then? Are you saying that killing Vlov that night was meaningless?"
<Page25>
"It wasn't pointless. You weren't fighting on my behalf. #Well, if you hadn't killed me, you wouldn't have had to."
<Page26>
"――――――"
A sudden weakness almost makes me fall to my knees.
...The fight that night was pointless.
...Killing Vlov hasn't solved anything.
<Page27>
...The vampire was still in town――― and I was prepared to put the blame, if only temporarily, on that guy.
...No.
Emptiness and self-loathing are circling around me.
<Page28>
"...Sorry, I know I'm being persistent, but let me check it one last time.
Vlov has nothing to do with the vampire murders, and it's another vampire that's been causing a stir in this city for the past month...?"
<Page29>
"Yes, that's what I meant.
But this is a problem that I have to deal with, so don't worry about it, Shiki. #It's not your problem, you know."
<Page30>
Arcueid looks up at me with a rather happy smile on her face.
<Page31>
"...What?!
I'm telling you, I can't afford to drop this."
I'm not sure how I feel about this.
If someone says something strange to me right now, I feel like I'm going to collapse from my feet.
<Page32>
"Oh, just a small question. It was when we defeated Vlov together. Hey, why was it three minutes?"
"Wait, what?"
<Page33>
"Shiki, you said we only had three minutes. I didn't understand that part at all."
"You don't know? I told you, that place was like the bottom of the ocean. That's why I said we only had three minutes."
<Page34>
"? At the bottom of the ocean, that's three minutes?"
"――――"
...Fantastic.
If I had more energy, I would say something back in no time.
<Page35>
"Well, yes. Humans, unlike you, can only stay under water for so long."
<Page36>
"What? I, I was a little cold too!
The bottom of the ocean can be boring after hours of diving!"
"A little cold," huh.
I thought I was going to die.
"? Why are you looking down?"
<Page37>
"...No, I'm just a little dizzy. Don't worry about it... No, you should care.
At the bottom of the ocean, even three minutes is doubtful. Humans are weak, don't compare them to someone as strong as yourself. Vampires should stick to games of endurance with other vampires."
<Page38>
Holding my head, I wave Arcueid off.
<Page39>
"...Well, I guess it's too late to tell you.
I've seen that you two are monsters.
Look, I was an idiot about the Vlov thing.
But more importantly, Arcueid..."
<Page40>
I manage to calm myself down and look up to resume the conversation, and...
What's with that face...?
<Page41>
"Arcueid...?"
"Why are you teasing me, Shiki?
I'm not human anyway!"
<Page42>
"Hmph," she pouts and turns away, strolling out of the park.
<Page43>
"Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going?"
"It shouldn't matter to Shiki the human! Don't follow me!"
I'm not sure if she's really upset, but Arcueid has gone without looking back.
<Page44>
"..............."
I wonder where she's going.
Did I step on a landmine?
Looking back, I may have treated her too harshly...
<Page45>
"...No, but, did I say anything bad like that...?"
...I didn't, did I?
Still, I feel like it's my fault since she got so mad at me... That was all over the place. It's really the worst.
<Page46>
"...Oh, god, I'm sorry, that was my fault!
I said it, so hold on and stop!"
<Page47>
I rushed to chase after that white back.
It's definitely not because I felt guilty for upsetting her.
In the first place, we haven't continued with the important part of the story...!
