<Page1>
"...Yeah. I think that's the best way to go."
<Page2>
I can't talk about Arcuied or Vlov.
It's not like she would understand, and I don't want her to get involved.
Since I can't tell her the truth no matter what, I'll at least apologize honestly for my faults.
<Page3>
"―――Alright, let's go."
Taking a deep breath, I open the door to the living room.
<Page4>
"Good morning, #Nii-san. #Oddly enough, it feels like it's been a long time." #
No, well... isn't my sister a little too overpowering?
<Page5>
"Y-Yo. Morning, Akiha."
"There is no need for greetings, so please take a seat over there.
Yes, it seems that we have a lot to catch up on, don't you think?"
<Page6>
"............"
...Is it just my imagination, or does it look like she's having fun?
It must be that. It's like a snake in front of a frog or something similar.
Perhaps it would have been a good idea to just say hello and then leave.
<Page7>
"―――Nii-san?"
"Y, yeah, I'll take a seat!"
<Page8>
My naive idea of running away vanishes with a single glance from Akiha.
I sit down on the sofa slowly, holding back the pain in my left leg.
<Page9>
"I'm seated now."
"You did not need to say that... Please do not dampen my spirit with your bizzare attitude. It's unfair."
<Page10>
"Why would it be unfair?"
"Of course it's unfair. If you give me a face like that, I'll be rela――――#Ahem.
<Page11>
After stopping her statement with a cough, Akiha glares at me with an even sharper gaze.
<Page12>
"Nii-san. As prompt as this may be, would you mind telling me about what happened yesterday and the day before?"
<Page13>
Akiha picks up the teacup as she speaks with grace.
Although her words resembled a question, it was most definitely closer to an order.
But as her older brother, I can't let her hear such a story. I would much rather have Akiha hate me than worry about me.
<Page14>
"So about that, Akiha."
"Yes, what is it?"
"To be frank, I can't explain the situation."
<Page15>
Crash.
With that, the teacup that Akiha was holding drops onto the table.
No, it's more accurate to say that she let it drop on purpose.
<Page16>
"Akiha-sama―――"
"Oh, I apologize, Hisui. Could you clean that up for me?"
<Page17>
What a terrifying voice.
Hisui silently cleans up the spilled tea and the broken... very expensive looking... teacup.
Still, what a terrifying voice.
After cleaning up, Hisui leaves the living room.
<Page18>
"―――So then, Nii-san."
"...What?"
"Would you be so inclined as to tell me more about the events of the past two days?"
<Page19>
Have I gone back in time?
The head of the family is determined to make me talk.
<Page20>
...But even so, I can't talk about the situation.
Even if it's for my own sake, I can't,
I can't let Akiha hear such a story.
<Page21>
"...No matter how many times you ask, I cannot tell you the story.
It was bad of me to cause you needless worry. And I also apologise for not getting in touch. But even so, there are some things that I cannot talk about."
<Page22>
"So you say that you feel bad, and yet you won't say anything, Nii-san.
Do you not even have an excuse?"
<Page23>
"...No, well..."
As much as I'd like to explain myself,
<Page24>
"I don't have a good excuse...
"But I haven't done anything wrong in the past two days... That, I want to believe in."
<Page25>
...That's right. Those two days were nothing but kill or be killed.
Despite that, I want to believe that I made the right choice.
There is also the reason of wanting to help Arcueid, but above all, I have no regrets of killing that vampire.
Even though I didn't act fast enough, at least no one else will be killed from their blood being sucked from now on.
<Page26>
"...Sorry, Akiha.
I know it's frustrating, but please don't ask any more questions."
<Page27>
"―――――"
Akiha stares into my eyes.
The suffocating atmosphere persists for a little while longer.
<Page28>
"Is that so.
Come to think of it, you do have your own circumstances, and it is not my place to meddle deeply into your affairs."
"...Sorry. I really appreciate you saying that."
"――――"
