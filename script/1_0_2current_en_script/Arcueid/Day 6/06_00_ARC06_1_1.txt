<Page1>
"...Yeah. I think that's the best way to do it."
<Page2>
I can't talk about Arcueid or Vlov.
It's not like she would understand, and I don't want her to get involved.
Though I absolutely cannot tell her the truth, I can at at least apologize honestly for my failings.
<Page3>
"―――Alright, let's go."
Taking a deep breath, I open the door to the living room.
<Page4>
"Good morning,# Nii-san.#It's strange, but I feel as though it's been quite some time since I last saw you." //Trailing space required at end so the glue parses, but there is a forced line break after Nii-san so no space there. This actally gets injected badly by the current version of deepLuna due to how glue is implemented. Will be fixed. 不思議と、ずいぶん久しぶりな気がしますね
No, well... isn't my little sister a bit too overpowering?
<Page5>
"Y-Yo. Morning, Akiha."
"There is no need for greetings, so please take a seat over there.
Yes, it seems that we have a lot to catch up on, don't you think?"
<Page6>
"............"
...Is it just my imagination, or does it look like she's having fun?
She must be. I'm like a deer caught in the headlights.//Not entirely sure what アレか is referring to. アレか。カエルを前にした蛇とか、そういうヤツか。
Perhaps it would be a good idea to just respond with an appropriate greeting and then retreat.//やっぱりこのまま適当に挨拶をして撤退するのが良策なのか。
<Page7>
"―――Nii-san?"
"Y, yeah, I'll take a seat right away!"
<Page8>
A single glare from Akiha was enough to dash my naive thoughts of escape.//逃げよう、なんて甘い考えは秋葉のひと睨みで霧散した。
I sit down on the sofa slowly, holding back the pain in my left leg.
<Page9>
"I'm seated now."
"You did not need to say that... Please do not dampen my spirit with your bizzare attitude. It's unfair."
<Page10>
"Why would it be unfair?"
"Of course it's unfair. If you make that face at me, I'll let my guard do――――#Ahem."//卑怯でしょう。そんな顔をされたら気が緩―――コホン
<Page11>
After stopping her statement with a cough, Akiha glares at me with an even sharper gaze than before.
<Page12>
"Nii-san. I know this is sudden, but would you mind elucidating for me precisely what you have been up to these past two days?"//兄さん。早速ですが、一昨日と昨日のお話を聞かせていただけませんか
<Page13>
As she eloquently makes her remarks, Akiha picks up her teacup.//優雅に言いつつ、ティーカップを手に取る秋葉。
Though her sentence may have ended with a question, there's no mistaking the fact that it is actually an order.//聞かせていただけませんか、などと言っているものの、間違いなく命令だ。
But, as her older brother, I can't let her hear about what actually transpired. I would much rather have Akiha hate me than worry about me.
<Page14>
"So about that, Akiha."
"Yes, what is it?"
"To be frank, I can't explain the situation."
<Page15>
Crash.
At that, the teacup that Akiha was holding fell onto the table.
No, it's more accurate to say that she dropped it on purpose.
<Page16>
"Akiha-sama―――"
"Oh, I apologize, Hisui. Could you clean that up for me?"
<Page17>
What a terrifying voice.
Hisui silently cleans up the spilled tea and the broken... very expensive looking... teacup.
Still, what an utterly terrifying voice.
After she finishes cleaning up, Hisui leaves the living room.
<Page18>
"―――So then, Nii-san."
"...What?"
"Would you be so inclined as to tell me more about the events of these past two days?"
<Page19>
Have I gone back in time?
The head of the family is determined to make me talk.
<Page20>
...But even so, I can't talk to her about the situation.
Even if it's for my own sake, I can't tell Akiha.
There's no way I can let her hear such a tale.
<Page21>
"...No matter how many times you ask, I still cannot tell you.
It was wrong of me to cause you needless worry. I also apologise for not getting in touch. But even so, there are some things that I cannot talk about."
<Page22>
"So you say that you feel bad, and yet you won't say anything, Nii-san.
Do you not even have an excuse?"
<Page23>
"...No, well..."
As much as I'd like to explain myself―――
<Page24>
"I don't have a good excuse...
But I haven't done anything wrong in the past two days... That, I want to believe in."
<Page25>
...That's right. Those two days were nothing but kill or be killed.
Despite that, I want to believe that I made the right choice.
I wanted to help Arcueid, true, but even putting that reason aside I still have no regrets about killing that vampire.//致命的に間に合わなかったとしても、もうこの先、血を吸われて殺される“誰か”はいなくなったのだから。
I may not have acted fast enough, and that may have cost lives, but at least from now on nobody will die as a result of having their blood sucked.//致命的に間に合わなかったとしても、もうこの先、血を吸われて殺される“誰か”はいなくなったのだから。
<Page26>
"...Sorry, Akiha.
I know it's frustrating, but please don't ask any more questions."
<Page27>
"―――――"
Akiha stares into my eyes.
The suffocating atmosphere persists for a little while longer.
<Page28>
"Is that so.
Come to think of it, you do have your own set of circumstances, and it is not my place to meddle deeply with your affairs."
"...Sorry. I really appreciate you saying that."
"――――"
