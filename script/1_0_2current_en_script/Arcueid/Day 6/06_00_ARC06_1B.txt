Hisui is waiting for me in the hallway.
My left leg is hurt so badly that I want to scream after every step.
Although my entire body feels heavy, it is only a slight muscular pain. It's not as painful as it seems.
<Page2>
I confirmed with my hands that the cuts I received from Vlov's ice fragments on areas such as my cheeks and shoulders had completely recovered.
The unnatural lack of even a scar makes it clear that it was the work of Arcueid. She did say that she would treat me after all, that woman.

"Shiki-sama. I'm sorry to be so intrusive, but please use this."

Hisui timidly presents a long and narrow rod.
It's a cane... no, a walker.
<Page5>
"So you did have something like this, huh."
"Yes. I remembered seeing it in the equipment room previously. So I had searched for it with that sliver of hope in mind."
<Page6>
Sliver of hope is a bit of an exaggeration... I smile at that statement before noticing the slight increase in Hisui's breathing.
She must have hurried to get it in the small time window while I was changing.
<Page7>
"Thank you. To be honest, it felt like I was going to jump from my heel with every step. You've been a great help."
"Of course. I'm glad to be of service."
<Page8>
The weight of my left leg is transferred to my left hand on the walker.
With this, I can walk without an issue. I thank Hisui for her thoughtfulness once again and move towards the lobby with her.
<Page9>
―――Well, we've arrived.
<Page10>
I place the walker next to the door.
Right ahead, at the other side of the door is the ever so present head of the Tohno family, Akiha-sama... Although she is my one year younger sister, she is eagerly waiting for an explanation from her pitiful older brother....
This place really is a cruel home of a devil.
<Page11>
No, this is not the time to be whining.
This is the consequences of my own actions. Regardless of the situation, I was absent from school without permission for a day and didn't return back home for two.
It's no wonder that Akiha wants an explanation.
<Page12>
That being said, I should―――
C:>Apologize honestly.
C:>Try to fool her.
C:>Tell her the truth.
