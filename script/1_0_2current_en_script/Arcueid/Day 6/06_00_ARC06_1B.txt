Hisui is waiting for me in the hallway.
My left leg is hurt so badly that every step I take makes me want to scream.
Although my entire body feels heavy, it's only a slight muscle ache. It's not actually all that painful.
<Page2>
I felt around with my hands to confirm, but it seems that the cuts I received on my cheeks and shoulders from Vlov's ice shards have healed completely.//手で確認したが、ヴローヴの氷の破片で受けた頬や肩の切り傷は完治していた。
The unnatural lack of any scars makes it clear that this is Arcueid's handiwork. She did say that she would treat me after all.//傷跡さえない不自然さから、アルクェイドの仕業なのは明白だ。手当てをする、とか言ってたし、あいつ。
<Page3>
"Shiki-sama. My apologies for being so forward, but please make use of this."//志貴さま。さしでがましいこととは存じますが、こちらをお使いください
"Hm?"
<Page4>
Hisui timidly presents a long and narrow rod.
It's a cane... no, a crutch.//"歩行器" does seem to mean a Zimmer frame, but those aren't a long thin rod? Translated as crutch since that makes more sense.
<Page5>
"Oh, this is perfect."//Assuming this is よく合った? よくあったね、こんなの
"Yes. I had remembered seeing it in the equipment room previously. I searched for it while holding on to that sliver of hope."
<Page6>
'Sliver of hope' is a bit of an exaggeration... I smile at the turn of phrase before noticing that Hisui's breathing is a little elevated.
She must have hurried to fetch it during the small time window while I was changing.
<Page7>
"Thank you. To be honest, I felt as if my foot was about to fall off with every step. This is a lifesaver."//This is pretty liberal, but I'm not sure of a good direct idiom for カカトから飛び上がりそうだった, and a literal TL just doesn't make sense
"Of course. I am glad to be of service."
<Page8>
I shift the weight of my body off of my left leg, and onto my left hand through the crutch.//左脚にかかる体重を、歩行器越しに左手で受け止める。
With this, I can walk without issue. I thank Hisui once again for her thoughtfulness, and together we head toward the lobby.
<Page9>
―――Well, we've arrived.
<Page10>
I lean the crutch up against the wall beside the door.//Wall reified 歩行器をドアの横に立てかける。
Straight ahead, on the other side of this door, the head of the Tohno family, Akiha-sama, is in attendance... She may be a year younger, my little sister... yet now she impatiently lies in wait for her pitiful older brother to make his excuses to her.//ここから先、扉一枚<隔|へだ>てた向こうには遠野家当主であらせられる秋葉さま……一歳年下、妹……が、哀れな兄の弁明を今か今かと待ち構えているという……。
This place really is the cruel home of a devil.
<Page11>
No, complaining won't solve anything.
These are the consequences of my own actions. Regardless of the circumstances, I was absent from school without permission for one day and didn't return home for two.
It's no wonder that Akiha demands an explanation.
<Page12>
In this situation, I should―――//ここはやはり―――
C:> Apologize sincerely.
C:> Try to fool her.
C:> Tell her the truth.
