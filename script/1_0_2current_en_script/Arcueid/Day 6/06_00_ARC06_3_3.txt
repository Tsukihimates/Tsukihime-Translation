Right, let's go out to the area in front of the station.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to go downhill with my legs, but if it hurts, I can just go home.
<Page2>
When I said "I'm leaving for a bit",# Hisui comes to see me off all the way to the front gate.
"Shiki-sama, at what time do you expect to return?"
<Page3>
"You don't have to worry. I'll make sure to come back by evening today."
"Very well. In that case, please have a safe trip."
<Page4>
Hisui bows deeply.
Feeling embarrassed towards this, I leave the mansion.
<Page5>
The next thing I know, I arrived at the north exit of the station.
It hasn't even been a day since the incident last night.
<Page6>
There are off-limits signs around the perimeter along with a number of guards.
The guard count is unusually large. The people were arranged such that they were 5 meters apart.
Even a kitten would have trouble getting inside like this.
<Page7>
...The news reported this fire incident as being a gas explosion due to an underground pipe.
The death toll is now over 20. More than 50 people have been injured.
The number of police officers is not included among them.
From within those flames. The records of those who bravely stood up to the vampire and were burned to death were not disclosed to the public.
<Page8>
"......?"
I notice something strange in the distance that brings me discomfort.
The collapsed area is tightly roped and became restricted.
<Page9>
There is no one going in or out of it.
I thought it would be packed with people doing investigations of the incident or restoring the area...?
<Page10>
"...Or rather, to begin with..."
The number of police cars is too few.
This area is guarded by a private security company, and there are not many policemen in sight.
It seems that the police are short-staffed due to dealing with a string of accidents.
<Page11>
I leave the scene of the incident and return to the front of the station.
I sit down on a bench and watch the crowds of people travelling along.
...I wonder how long I'll be doing this.
Suddenly.
I spot the figure of her back and stand up immediately, only to realize that I was mistaken.
<Page12>
"―――Geez, what the hell was that?"
I have no reason to talk to her.
In the first place, there's no reason for Arcueid to remain in this city after achieving her goal of eliminating that vampire.
...How foolish of me.
There's no reason for me to be killing time in a place like this, so why did I decide to come all the way out to the city?
<Page13>
"...That's right. We've always had that kind of relationship, so now that I know I don't have to do such crazy things anymore, I feel kind of refre―――"
<Page14>
I close my mouth before I could finish my sentence.
Muttering out such an obvious lie would only end in futile.
Well, it is a relief to be rid of her, but whether it's a good thing or not is an enitrely different matter.
<Page15>
...After all, there are still feelings that remain even now.
Regret, lingering attachment, and so forth.
She was a girl who brought nothing but trouble, but even so, it was... well, a little fun to be together with her.
<Page16>
"...Geez, I really am an idiot."
How can I call it attachment when I was almost killed once?
The wound from last night still remains on my leg.
I remember how Vlov was almost able to kill me.
I don't want to go through something like that ever again.
<Page17>
"It's almost evening, I should go back to the mansion."
I shake my head to cool down my fever and turn my back on the imaginary illusion that is Arcueid.
