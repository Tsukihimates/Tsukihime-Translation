"I understand. I will refrain from pursuing this matter any further.
After all, I am also at fault for you not being able to contact me."
"But there's no way that you're at fault here right?"
<Page2>
<Page3>
"I understand. I will refrain from pursuing this matter any further.
After all, I am also at fault for you not being able to contact me."
"But there's no way that you're at fault here right?"
<Page4>
"But there's no way that you're at fault here right?"
<Page5>
"I was the one who took away your cell phone.
If you had it back then, even a careless brother like you would have at least tried to contact me, am I wrong?"
<Page6>
"――――"
Well... no, but actually...
Kohaku did secretly return it to me, but...
<Page7>
"However, #that will be the sole exception. Please refrain from such conduct in the future. You are the only male of the Tohno family after all, so it will be troublesome if you don't understand your own position a little better.
If bad publicity were to spread, it would affect the future social relations of the Tohno family."
<Page8>
Future social relations... You mean between me and some other prestigious family?
<Page9>
"Well, surely it's not that much of an issue. They never had any interest in what I did, my relatives that is.
In fact, you're the successor of the Tohno family, so if it's about family matters, you could have sent me someplace else or find a more suitable son-in-law."
"―――――"
<Page10>
...?
For some reason, Akiha falls silent.
"What's wrong? Are you not feeling well, Akiha?"
<Page11>
"I'm fine. If you can afford to think about me, please take better care of yourself instead.
After all, you're the one with chronic anemia, Nii-san."
"...Mmm."
She's right. I do collapse from anemia rather frequently.
<Page12>
"In any case, please do not leave the house alone too often.
Even without me saying, the city has become very dangerous these days. People like yourself that act so vacantly are practically asking to be attacked by random attackers after all."
<Page13>
"In that case, it's okay. Those kinds of incidents will never happen again."
<Page14>
The series of murders that had the city in an uproar.
The reportedly modern-day vampire, the culprit that had yet to be discovered even now, and the darkness of the night terrorizing the people.
However, all of that is now in the past.
<Page15>
"――――Huh?"
"I mean that there aren't any more vampires. The killer has already been caught."
<Page16>
"Is that so? #That is good news indeed, but... Nii-san, you sure seem to know a lot about this."
"Y-Yeah. I just happened to be at the scene of the arrest and whatnot."
<Page17>
I laugh at the ridiculousness of my own statement.
I suppose it really was all just a series of coincidences.
<Page18>
The two days I spent with Arcueid.
So much has happened that it feels like a dream even now, but at any rate, the monster that had been nesting in the city is gone.
When I put it like that, I can say that I was glad and be proud at that fact.
<Page19>
"Nii-san? What's the matter, you look so happy all of a sudden."
"It's nothing special.
It's just that, I realized that it was finally all over."
<Page20>
I smile and murmur those words without reazling it.
In any case, it seems that Akiha accepts it even with an explanation like that.
I thank her and stand up.
<Page21>
"Well, now that I feel better, I'm starving. Can I go and get some breakfast?"
<Page22>
"T-There's no need for you to ask me for permission.
I am not responsible for managing your breakfast, so please take care of it yourself. If it's Kohaku you're after, she's probably preparing breakfast in the kitchen."
"Thank you. Then if you'll excuse me."
<Page23>
I head towards the doorway and begin walking.
Tch... My left leg, it still hurts as expected.
<Page24>
"Stop right there, Nii-san.
I have been wondering about it for a while, but now it is clear. Your leg is hurt, isn't it?"
<Page25>
"Ah... Well, it's more like a sprain, or rather a pulled muscle. In any case, it's not that big of a deal, so don't worry about it."
"Is that so. Not a big deal, you say."
<Page26>
Akiha walks briskly towards me.
And just like that, she makes eye contact with me, and then casually,
<Page27>
"There."
"UKYAAAAH!?"
She steps on the most swollen part of my left foot with precision as if she could see through the affected area―――!
<Page28>
"What a surprise. It seems that even your poker face is fragile when it comes to direct pain."
<Page29>
"That's because it's weak. Or rather, I should be the one who's surprised!
You knew what you were doing, didn't you!?"
<Page30>
"You've got it wrong. I was simply testing it out with all my courage, believing my brother's words that it wasn't a serious injury."
<Page31>
The demonic sister smiles gracefully as she giggles.
What the hell, could you be any less transparent? This is clearly payback for me not telling her about the situation.
<Page32>
Akiha returns to the sofa in an extremely good mood while pretending as if nothing happened and elegantly sips her tea.
<Page33>
"Well then. You were right in that it wasn't such a big injury, but it wouldn't be good to just leave it alone."
<Page34>
"Nii-san, I'm ordering you as the head of the family.
Go see the doctor as soon as you have finished your breakfast. Regardless of the reason for your injury, it would be bothersome to have you whine about the pain."
<Page35>
"Sure, I want to go and get treated, but... don't you want to ask me how I got hurt?"
<Page36>
"I'm not interested. It's probably due to some trivial reason anyways. But even if I did ask, you would still keep it a secret, wouldn't you, Nii-san?"
A blunt reply from the head of the family.
<Page37>
"If it's a sprain without any external wounds, Kohaku can take care of it.
Oh... That's right, Dr. Arach was here this morning too, wasn't she?
That person was originally a surgeon.
Kohaku for medical treatment, or Dr. Arach for surgery.
Please choose whichever you please."
<Page38>
...What an unexpected turn of events.
I'll―――
C:>Have Kohaku take care of me.
C:>Have Dr. Arach take care of me.
