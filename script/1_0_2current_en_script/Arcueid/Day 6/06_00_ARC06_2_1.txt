<Page1>
I'll let Kohaku-san take care of me.
A compress and some painkillers should be enough.
<Page2>
"Understood. In that case, please wait in your room after finishing your meal.
I will be going out because of a dinner I need to attend to this evening, but even when I am away, I humbly request that you show some restraint, Nii-san."
<Page3>
Akiha smiles reassuringly, happy for whatever reason.
...Now then.
For now, I'll have breakfast and then get some medical treatment afterwards.
<Page4>
"Thank you for waiting!"# Kohaku-san comes in with a retro wooden box.
<Page5>
"Sorry, Kohaku-san. For calling you here while you were busy."
"Not at all. Today is a holiday, so there was not much work to be done. No need to worry.
This is your request after all. As long as you are okay with me, I am always happy to help."
<Page6>
Kohaku comes to the bed with an energetic smile on her face.
<Page7>
"Without further ado, it is time for your examination. Please take a seat on the bed. As for the extent of your injury... #I see, so it is not just your left leg, but your entire lower body, right?"
<Page8>
"Eh... you can tell that much just by looking?"
"Yes, I can do that much. I do not hold any licenses, but I have been training in the field of medicine and osteopathy since I was a child."
<Page9>
Medicine and osteopathy... So that's what Akiha meant when she referred to Kohaku for 'medical treatment'.
I sit down on the bed and roll up my pants to let her examine my left leg for the time being.
<Page10>
A light palpation. I feel like screaming out in pain every time Kohaku-san traces my shin with her finger.
And then...
<Page11>
"Um... Shiki-san?
Is your bone fractured by any chance?"
<Page12>
Ah... So that's how it is.
Though I'm glad that it is only a fracture.
I wouldn't be surprised if things were broken all over my body.
<Page13>
"I suppose so. But I'm sure it's just a small one.
After all, I was able to tolerate it for this long."
<Page14>
"...Sigh. I think I am starting to understand Akiha-sama's feelings a bit more. You must be at your worst when you look calm, no, especially during those times right?
Please wait a moment, I will bring some of my prized ointment and other things. Until then, do not move away from the bed."
<Page15>
Kohaku-san walks out of the room with pattering footsteps.
...I feel a strange sense of guilt after being left alone.
To think that Kohaku-san could speak with such a lifeless voice just now.
<Page16>
Kohaku-san's treatment is more orthodox than I expected.
After applying the ointment, she tapes up my heel to hold it in place and then plasters a cast all the way to my shin.
<Page17>
"No, you didn't have to go that far."
"Of course I have to.
What do you take your own body for?
Besides, where did you even get this injury in the first place? As someone who is in charge of your health, I cannot overlook this matter."
<Page18>
"Uh... Well, you see..."
"Shiki-san. Please be honest with me."
"It was... something, like a fight. Things got a little heated so we hit each other."
<Page19>
It's a poor excuse, but there was no other way to explain it.
I couldn't just fool the serious Kohaku-san into thinking that it was nothing at all.
<Page20>
"A fight, you say? Geez, you know you should not be doing that.
I think it is okay to be naughty, but violence is a no go! It just ends up with both the person who raised their hand and the struck person to be hurt."
<Page21>
"......"
So it hurts the one who hit and the one who's hit. huh.
Kohaku-san's words have an oddly poignant weight to them.
<Page22>
"...Yeah. I guess you're right. I suppose that fighting does end in only pain."
"Right? And yet you disappointed me by getting hurt like this.
Regardless of the circumstances, my view of you will go down if you do those sorts of things."
"...Yeah, I'm reflecting on how stupid I was too. I'll work hard to make sure this never happens again."
<Page23>
"Yes, it is fine as long as you understand.
With that, I will be examining your upper body, so please take off your clothes."
"―――Excuse me?"
<Page24>
Kohaku-san stands up without hesitation and grabs my shirt.
In other words. She's telling me to get naked.
<Page25>
"W-Wait a minute!
You don't have to go that far, it's only my legs that hurts!"
<Page26>
"What are you saying?
Your legs may be in terrible condition, but I assure you that your shoulders and waist are even worse. Look, they are slightly inflamed, are they not?"
<Page27>
"Ow?! What, was that just now? A pressure point?! Or rather, that vicious hand technique, don't tell me it was that old man from the Jinan Clinic who taught you that method of osteopathy?!"
<Page28>
"Indeed. I had Dr. Jinan teach me rigorously about your body in great details.# Also, vicious is not the right word. Please call it skillful handiwork instead ♡"
<Page29>
"Wha―――!"
I'm easily knocked face-down on the bed...!
Dr. Jinan was a local osteopath who had taken care of me while I was living under the Arima family.
Even now, he's at the top of the list of people that I owe a great deal to while simultaneously being someone who I want to beat up someday.
<Page30>
"No, that's not the point! If it's inflamed, I can put a compress on it myself! There's no need for me to get naked!"
"―――Haha. You're embarassed, aren't you, Shiki-san?"
With a smiling grin, Kohaku ignores me and starts to take off my shirt. //I'm not sure if smiling grin is a right term here, they feels redundant for me, pls check again just to be sure.
<Page31>
"Besides, I'm already used to seeing your body. It's fine so just resign yourself if you could please.
I did change your clothes last night after all. I know everything right down to the location of the mole on your back."
<Page32>
"――――――"
Now that she mentions it, I was in my sleep-wear when I woke up and not my school uniform!
<Page33>
"Come on, don't be so violent now.
Otherwise, that cast on your leg that I worked so hard on will come off."
<Page34>
...There's not much I can say to that. But even so, being naked in front of Kohaku-san is a bit...
<Page35>
"Geez. In that case it can't be helped. I'll just have to examine your back alone. That way it won't be embarrassing for you, right?"
<Page36>
It's still embarassing, but it's the best deal I'm going to get.
If I wanted to put a compress on my back, I'd have to get someone to do it for me anyways.
<Page37>
"...I guess so. In that case, I'll leave it to you."
I resign myself and relax.
"I will disinfect it as well just in case. After all, you might have a small wound if you have been in a fight."
<Page38>
The antiseptic sinks into my skin.
It's been a long past two days. I must have grazed myself in some places without realizing it.
<Page39>
The antiseptic stings, but it's nothing compared to the dizziness of my anemia. And as she is applying the antiseptic...
"Wow, you really are a man."
I think I was able to endure the pain because of how delighted Kohaku-san was.
<Page40>
And so Kohaku-san's examination comes to a close.
After an hour of an unexpectedly standard examination, I'm reminded once again of how amazing this person is.
<Page41>
"Thank you, Kohaku-san. My left leg doesn't hurt anymore, and with this, I can finally relax this afternoon."
<Page42>
"Do not mention it, the pleasure is all mine.
In that case, I will be returning back to work now.
If the pain does not go away or if it gets worse, please let me know right away. I will be in the kitchen this afternoon preparing dinner."
Kohaku-san goes out of the room, leaving behind a lively smile.
<Page43>
Now then.
I should also figure out what to do this afternoon...
