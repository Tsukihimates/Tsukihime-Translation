The gentle rays of the sun dispel my sleepiness.
Though my eyes remain closed, I can feel the serenity of my surroundings seep into every pore.//目を閉じていても皮膚感覚で周囲の静けさは読み取れる。
The air is moderately cool, yet gentle.
The sky seems to be the clearest it's ever been today.
<Page2>
In that case, I should get up and go to school.
After all, I've been so beset by misfortune these past two days I almost forgot I was still a student―――
<Page3>
"......."
...I open my eyes.//Prefer open eyes to wake up here, since he's already _conscious_ he just has his eyes closed (L3). 目が覚めた
I'm lying on the bed, and my glasses are next to my pillow.//Replaced 体 with "I", since it felt a bit detached otherwise 体はベッドに横になっていて、枕元には眼鏡がある。
<Page4>
I put them on out of force of habit, and let my gaze wander.//条件反射で眼鏡をかけ,
The sunlight through the window is so vibrant that I can almost hear it calling me outside.
<Page5>
I take a deep breath #and inhale the fresh air.//とりこむ promoted to inhale 深呼吸をして新鮮な空気をとりこむ。
...Oh, right. It's Sunday, so there's no school.
<Page6>
The hands of the clock make a ticking sound.
I can hear little birds chirping outside.//小鳥
―――Aah, I'm back.
It's a morning just like any other, but on this occasion it feels exceptionally pure.//普段通りの朝なのに、今はこんなにも清らかなものに感じている。
<Page7>
"―――Thank goodness."
I don't feel this way because I'm alive, or because I was able to do something about that <vampire|V l o v   >.//Felt too vague without reference to the feeling of thank goodness 自分が生きている事とか、<吸血鬼|ヴローヴ>をどうにか出来た事とかじゃなくて
I'm thankful because I was able to go back to my normal life after going through that extraordinary event. Thankful that I can happily enjoy a morning like this.//Similar reification of thankfuThankful that
There is no greater reward for a humble person like myself―――//I don't think ちっぽけな人間 is _literal_ here.
<Page8>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama.#"
"UWAAAAAAH!"
<Page9>
I reflexively snap bolt upright.//思わず上半身が跳ねあがる。
I look over, and see Hisui standing to attention in front of the door.//控える seems a bit more 'in readiness' than just plain stand
<Page10>
"H-Hisui―――"
<Page11>
"...My sincerest apologies.
It seemed that you were rather unaware of my presence, so I decided to call out to you, but..."
"Ah―――no, well, I'm sorry as well."
<Page12>
She startled me.//Past tense. びっくりした。
I've only just woken up, and already my heart is pounding...//起き抜けの心臓がバクバクしている
<Page13>
"...Huh? But it's not even 7 o'clock."
"Yes. It is a little earlier than when you usually wake up, Shiki-sama."
"I guess so. What brings you all the way here then, Hisui?"
<Page14>
"I came to wake you up.//志貴さまを起こしにまいりました。
Akiha-sama wishes for you to explain to her what you have been up to these past two days, and has instructed me to bring you before her by any means necessary."//秋葉さまから、ここ二日間の事情を説明してもらいますので、テコを使ってでも連れて来るように、と言付かっております
<Page15>
"――――――"
'Akiha', 'the past two days', 'explain'.
The cryptic words fly around inside my brain.
<Page16>
Resisting the temptation to abandon the train of thought, I take 10 seconds to piece things together.//思考を放棄したい誘惑に耐えながら、察すること10秒。
...Now that I think about it―――or rather, no matter how much I consider it―――there's no way that I can explain the events of the past two days.//そういえば。というか、どう考えても、この二日間の行動は弁明のしようがない
<Page17>
Absence without leave. Violation of curfew. And to top it off, a complete lack of communication.//無断欠席。門限破り。おまけに音信不通ときた。
Akiha is scary enough when I don't come home before dusk. I shudder to think what kind of face she's making right now.//アイツがいまどんな顔をしているのか、恐ろしくて想像もできない
<Page18>
"...Hey, Hisui.
Would it be an exaggeration to say that Akika is angry...?"//Struggling with a non-weird tl of 控えめに言って
<Page19>
"Hmm, who's to say.
You will have to find that out for yourself, Shiki-sama."
<Page20>
Okay. Hisui's tone also comes off as somewhat cold and dispassionate.//よし。心なしか、翡翠の声もさりげなく冷たかった。
If this is how it's going to be, I should have returned to the mansion even if I had to crawl―――
Even if I... had to crawl?//Echo from prev sentence 這って、でも？
<Page21>
"Wait, hold up.
Before that, why was I asleep in my room...?"
"You returned to the mansion last night a little after two o'clock in the morning.
I am told that Nee-san discovered you asleep at the front door, and brought you to your room."
<Page22>
"――――――――"
...My mouth hangs wide open.
I was radio silent, then came home late last night and didn't even make it back to my room, instead falling asleep in the entryway like some feral drunk that missed the last train home.//音信不通から深夜に帰宅、部屋にも戻れず玄関で眠っていた、とか、終電を逃した野生の酔っ払いそのものである。
<Page23>
"That woman, to treat people the same way you would a cat or something..."
Arcueid's face springs to mind.
...Well, I guess I should at least be grateful that she carried me as far as the doorway.
<Page24>
In any case, I understand the situation now.
"I'll go there right away, so if you could, well... ask Akiha to calm down as best you can, it would be much appreciated..."
<Page25>
"I am deeply sorry. For a number of reasons, I must refuse that order."
<Page26>
Hisui replies firmly.
It's clear to see that my standing within the Tohno household has plummeted to the lowest of the lumpen.//下層 is more like lower _class_ than just lower _level_, I think.  現在の遠野邸において遠野志貴の身分は最下層に転落したと見て間違いはない。
Since Akiha is the head of the mansion, it's no surprise that I have no allies when she's upset.
<Page27>
...That being said, I should get up.
It's no use staying in bed forever.//いつまでもベッドにいては始まらない。
<Page28>
"―――"
O―――uch.
As soon as I stand up, a tearing pain races through my legs.//立ちあがった途端、両脚に裂くような痛みが走った。
<Page29>
...So that's how it is. If I were to ask myself what I should be surprised about, it would be the fact that I'm still alive.
After doing all those crazy things, of course it would be unnatural for me to be able to enjoy the simple act of cherishing a morning like this.//あれだけの無茶をしておいて、こうして朝を迎えられる事自体が不自然だというのに。
<Page30>
"Shiki-sama...?
Is everything alright? You are... sweating, heavily."//I think that いかがなされましたか is polite asking how he is, not offering to help?
<Page31>
A copious amount of sweat is forming on my forehead.//額に大量の汗が噴き出ている。
It seems that just the pain of trying to walk is enough to cause my body to react like this.
<Page32>
"...If you are not feeling well, perhaps you would prefer to rest for a little while longer.
You cried out a little earlier, but if I were to put in a word with Akiha-sama..."//先ほどはああ申しましたが、秋葉さまには私から……
<Page33>
"No, it's alright. It's just a sprain, it'll go away soon.
Besides, Akiha is a much more pressing concern. If I keep making her wait, she'll just get even angrier."//それより秋葉の方が怖い。先延ばしにしたら、よけいに怒られそうだ
"――――"
<Page34>
Hisui's eyes are full of reproach, as if asking me not to tell lies.//翡翠の目は、嘘を言わないでください、と責めているようだ。
However, due to her position, she cannot press me about it.
...I'm really sorry, but right now I've no choice but to rely on this obvious subterfuge to make you agree.
<Page35>
"I'll head down to the lobby once I'm dressed.
It won't take long, so just wait for me in the hallway."
<Page36>
"...As you wish.
I humbly ask that you do not push yourself too hard."//どうかご無理はなさいませんよう、お願いします
<Page37>
Hisui bows deeply and leaves the room.
I change out of my pajamas and into some casual clothes, trying to move my body as little as possible.
My first weekend at home after seven years away is already off to a rocky start.//休日 liberalized to weekend, since we know it's Sunday 七年ぶりの実家での休日は、波乱含みで始まった。
