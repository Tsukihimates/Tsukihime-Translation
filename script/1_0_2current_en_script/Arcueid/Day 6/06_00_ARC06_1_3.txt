That's right, I should just tell the truth!
Besides, I don't want to lie to Akiha, and I wouldn't be able to deceive her with such an obvious lie in the first place.
<Page2>
After all, honesty is the best. I'm sure Akiha will understand if I explain everything in detail with all my heart.
I'm perfectly sane, it's just that I was becoming desperate.
<Page3>
"―――Okay, here we go."
From here on, it's all about freaking guts.
I take a deep breath and open the door to the living room.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Nii-san.
Strangely enough, it feels like it has been a long―――"
<Page5>
"Yeah. Good morning, Akiha."
<Page6>
Indeed, after blocking her "I am Angry" look with my smiling face (50 DEF), I sit on the opposite side of Akiha.
My heel hurts a lot, but I manage to get through it with a smile.
<Page7>
"I didn't get a chance to say it in the bedroom, but good morning to you too, Hisui.
Thanks for earlier. I'll be counting on you."
<Page8>
I also send my gratitude to Hisui who is standing by the wall.
I didn't know that my decision to be honest would lead to such a perfect good morning move. I should remember that.
<Page9>
"Y-You seem to be in very high spirits.
Although I thought for sure that you would reflect on your bad behavior of the past few days and be withered away."
<Page10>
"Of course I would reflect on my behavior. I'm self-aware after all.
But that and my good mood are two completely different things. I'm just simply happy to be able to see Akiha's face in the morning."
"――――――、#W-"
<Page11>
Akiha freezes like a statue.
Crap... did I... make her upset?
I see. It seems that being too honest is not good. I should overwrite my memory and keep that in mind.
<Page12>
"Akiha-sama."
"―――It is nothing, Hisui.
However, that was a splendid greeting just now."
<Page13>
Akiha clears her throat and composes herself with a sigh.
<Page14>
"Nii-san. I am telling you, you cannot fool me with such emotionally charged sentiments."
"Emotionally charged huh."
<Page15>
"You cannot fool me with regular words either.
What I really want to hear is a report of where you have been and what you have been doing for the past two days."
<Page16>
"But that's the thing, Akiha."
"Yes. What kind of excuse will you give me this time, Nii-san?"
<Page17>
"It's a long story, so I'll try to keep it short.
For the past two days, I've been eradicating a vampire.
You know about the serial killings that's been happening in Souya, right? That killer was a vampire, but I was saved by a 'good vampire' who I happened to meet by chance.
And so I decided to return the favor by working together and fight against the 'bad vampire'."
<Page18>
"―――――――"
Akiha freezes in place.
It was a natural reaction. And in the next moment.
<Page19>
"Are you making fun of me, Nii-san!?"
I could easily imagine her yelling that at me.
<Page20>
But there's no other way to say it.
It's sad, but it's obvious that she won't believe me, so I'll just accept my title as the 'brother with a terrible excuse'...
<Page21>
"......"
......?
It does seem like her anger is real, but Akiha does not say a word.
<Page22>
"Hello, Akiha?"
"Nii-san. Was that some kind of sick joke just now?"
"――――――"
In complete silence, Akiha sees through my... no, pierces through my heart with her gaze.
<Page23>
"...No, I'm not kidding."
"This is a joke, right?"
"...Well, I can't blame you for taking it that way."
I end up agreeing with her through her complete seriousness.
<Page24>
"Very well. But in the future, please do not speak of such absurdities even if it is just a joke.
You can never know where our relatives might be listening. I do not wish to hear any rumors about you being unfit as the eldest son of the Tohno family."
<Page25>
...Akiha is neither angry nor disappointed.
Even through her stone-cold gaze, I can see that Akiha is concerned about my situation.
How do I put this... it was like a genuine sense of 'yearning' that was as hard as steel.
<Page26>
"I'm sorry. Forget what I just said. That joke was uncalled for, even for me."
<Page27>
"...It is fine. I will not press you down on this matter any further.
After all, I am also at fault for you not being able to contact me."
