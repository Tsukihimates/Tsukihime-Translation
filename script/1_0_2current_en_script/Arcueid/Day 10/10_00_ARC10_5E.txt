<Page1>
But before I can be sure.
A violent explosion sounded in front of her, and Arcueid 's body was blown away as if by a gust of wind.
<Page2>
"Wow, that was scary......! I tried to mess with her, thankfully she didn't fight back.......!
"Noel-sensei, .....!?"
<Page3>
"Good evening!
But I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk to you !"
When Noel-sensei came to my side and looks at Arcueid.
<Page4>
......Arcueid was safe.
She was blown nearly ten meters away, yet not a scratch on her.
<Page5>
"I..."
Arcueid was stunned.
I-I can't even think about what to do.
There.
<Page6>
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, Shiki.
If you turn it back, you'll be the next one. I'm sorry, but please be quiet there ♡ "
<Page7>
"What?"
A white wall rises up in front of me.
Before I knew it, there were three swords stuck in the ground around me.
Each sword is used as a fulcrum to form a triangle, and I, the one who is inside it, is confined by a wall of light.
<Page8>
"Fufu, a sacrament of the church received from master, the black key.
Oh, and please don't touch the wall, okay? You'll turn into a pillar of salt if you touch it. I don't really care if your hands are chlorinated or not.
What's more important now is―――"
<Page9>
"Shiki―――?"
Arcueid stands up.
After looking at me trapped in the wall, I looked at the woman in nuns' clothes next to me.
<Page10>
"The problem is that it's a monster that isn't hurt even if it's been suddenly attacked.
Damn. So my level of iron armor won't get through."
"Agent of the church..."
Arcueid presence changes.
Those eyes.
A swirling murderous energy shoots through the woman in the nun's uniform.
<Page11>
"......What are you doing ......?"
......! I can't, I can't!
I can't do anything about it!
<Page12>
"Shut up and go do your job.
It's your duty to put your body on the line against monsters."
"Aww, aww, aww! Oh, my God.
Please let the Lord see me throooough...!"
<Page13>
As if being pushed back, the woman in the nun's uniform leaps at Arcueid, tripping over herself.
......It's not even worth talking about.
There is no way she can stop Arcueid with such a rush.
<Page14>
"Let go of Shiki, ......!"
As a matter of fact, Arcueid starts rushing towards us, swinging one hand as if warding off a bug.
<Page15>
"What!?"
"Oh, my God!"
<Page16>
What the heck is...... you could stop Arcueid with a limp thrust like that ......!
<Page17>
"Oh, you can do it after all, can't you? You have to work hard for your pay.
Your food isn't provided for nothing.
<Page18>
From right beside me, I heard fluent but rough Japanese.
I turn to look at him, unable to move.
There he was,
the foreign child that I had met in front of the Tohno Mansion.
<Page19>
The child's hands were covered with what looked like metal gauntlets.
His fingers were moving up and down like a wave, making a clattering sound.
It vaguely reminded me of an old typewriter.
<Page20>
"Oh? What are you looking at, kid? This isn't unusual. Don't tell me that you don't know about Manipulation Doll. Diligence is a virtue of the Japanese people, you know.
<Page21>
He seems to be talking to me.
But is that what...... dolls are all about?
It is a street performance in which a wooden puppet with joints is connected to a string, hung from above, and made to appear 'alive' only by the movements of the manipulator's hands.
<Page22>
"I'm not sure if you can last two minutes, but I'm sure you can. ......I don't know what to do, I guess I'll just have to talk it out from here on out.#---#Hey, back off, Noel! You're going to get your head twisted off!"
<Page23>
The fight was loud.
The woman in the nun's uniform retreated as if to flee, and Arcueid, turned toward the wall of light---the one I was in.
<Page24>
"Ha-ha-ha... ...... ...!"
Her red eyes shone brightly.
Arcueid, breathing hard, bent over like a large predator that was about to leap over here in one move, but ......
<Page25>
"Ahhhh, this is terrible. You're not much different from those ghouls now. But you're still the last true ancestor, princess. The old man of Laurentius will be very disappointed when he sees you.
"What do you mean?"
<Page26>
Reason returns to Arcueid's eyes.
Perhaps seeing this as an opportunity, the kid beside me stepped forward and confronted the white vampire.
<Page27>
"It is a pleasure to meet you. I'm Mario Gallo Bestino, acting priest of Souya, Japan."
"Don't get me started on the height of the position. I hate to say it, but I'm the old man's second child, adopted for convenience."
"...... Yeah. This country's acting commander-in-chief?"
<Page28>
"Yeah, I just got here."
"I may have gotten it through riding on my parent's coattails,but a position is a position. I'm not gonna let shit go in my territory. ―――Especially if that fuckup happens to be a true ancestor fallen into evil, I'd rather eat shit than do that."
<Page29>
"――――――"
The will to fight disappears from Arcueid.
No, ...... that's fear, isn't it?
<Page30>
"You finally realized it. You tried to kill this kid by sucking his blood, you know.
Even if you say you're a True Ancestor, you're still a vampire, right? You can kill all the vampires you want, but in the end you're still a monster!"
"No... I would never try to kill Shiki."
<Page31>
"What are you playing at? I'm not talking about killing intent. It's a natural part of your biology. Where's your awareness that you're a nuisance just by existing? It's not like you didn't understand what this kid was thinking when he saw your true nature, right?"
"―――――"
<Page32>
"I can't believe my eyes. I seriously doubt my eyes. The old man said you were a cold-hearted weapon, but you're completely different.
Well. That eye. You've got that evil eye, and you've pointed it at the kid. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'll ask him how he felt about it."
<Page33>
The boy ...... Mario finally turns his gaze to me.
The sharpness of his gaze took my breath away.
Despite his foul mouth, this boy is full of... well, fairness.
<Page34>
"You're up, Tohno. Let her know what you think.
I almost got eaten in one bite, I was so scared I almost choked..."
"――――――"
I was about to yell at him, "That's not true," but stopped myself from speaking.
<Page35>
......That's a lie.
In fact, I was terrified. To cover that up, would hurt Arcueid more than lying about it...
<Page36>
"―――――――"
Arcueid looks away painfully.
<Page37>
"The acting priest is right. Back off, vampire. Did you really think that a monster like you would be allowed to be with humans?"
<Page38>
"Leave it to the powerful to subdue the humans.
It's a vile idea, typical of vampires, but I won't let it happen.
You should be grateful to us, Shiki-kun. You were almost turned into a vampire."
<Page39>
"――――――"
No, no, no. That's not true. It's true I was frightened. It's an indefensible fact. But it's not the only thing.
<Page40>
I've never been ...... uncertain.
She's always respected my choices.
I've never left anything to chance.
The only reason I was with Arcueid was because I wanted to be, not because of anyone else!"
<Page41>
No, ......! What's the matter with you guys, you come out of nowhere and talk like you know everything ......! Arcueid has never sucked blood before! That was just a joke. ......!"
<Page42>
"What are you saying? She's never sucked blood before? Do you seriously expect me to believe that crap?
Certainly the True Ancestors are excellent. There have been no casualties in the last eight hundred years. But that's not..."
<Page43>
"Shut up! I don't care about such a story!
I won't tolerate anyone that gets in Arcueid's way, no matter who you guys are.
That's not me―――#The real me is with Arcueid because I love her! Nobody else has the right to decide that!"
<Page44>
"Ha...? No forgiveness, huh?"
Noel's voice was filled with a faint hostility.
A part of what was pointed at Arcueid shifted to me.
Noel, her blade still dangling in her hand, wavered.
<Page45>
"Hey, Pigsy Noel."
"What? Pig? Did you say pig? Where? Why?
I mean, you talk too much! Just because you're the son of a wealthy man doesn't mean you're going to get too carried away with your# PiggySheaNyaaaaaa!!!?"
<Page46>
"...Um..."
The woman in the nun's uniform let out a strange cry and jumped around by herself.
The murderous intent I had earlier disappeared beyond the horizon.
...... Somehow, I'm starting to understand where Noel-Sensei is coming from. ......
<Page47>
"I'm really sorry that she threatened you. She's a chicken with a low boiling point. I'll give him a good talking to later, so don't be too hard on her.
...... But well, the idiot got a good word out, in her own stupid way.
You've never sucked blood before. Isn't that right, Arcueid Brunestud?"
<Page48>
"Arcueid?"
Arcueid did not answer.
She just looks down and bites her lip in frustration.
......It is.
It seems to be an implicitly acknowledgment of the child's words...
<Page49>
"And a correction. The warding I put on this kid was not to catch him. But to protect him from the scary monster that's here now."
What does that mean?
<Page50>
".................."
Arcueid's face rises.
'I'm sorry' she said.
In a slightly audible voice, she apologized, and
She leapt away from the scene as if fleeing into the darkness of the night.
