"...Yeah.
 It's because you want revenge on me, isn't it?"
"Revenge? Me, on Shiki?"
<Page2>
"...I killed you once, didn't I? //Double check the line below, I think it's a little confusing intentionally.
 I was forgiven for the Vlov situation, but that was just to make up for the fact that it couldn't be undone, or maybe I was able to pay off my debt, but the inconvenience I caused when I took the loan is still there..."
<Page3>
"? If the balance is alright, what's the problem?"
".........."
<Page4>
 As a matter of fact, the odds are not in my favor.
 I killed Arcueid, and then I was useful as a guard.
<Page5>
 But apart from that, Arcueid took my irresponsible word for it and protected this city.
 ...In my mind, I don't feel like I've given anything back to her.
<Page6>
"Well... yeah, it's an emotional thing, I guess.
 When you think back to the time you were killed, it's infuriating, isn't it?
 You think, "I can't forgive him. I'll get even again someday.""
<Page7>
"Hmmm... it's not that I don't want to get back at you, but... Shiki, you've never been on time for our meetings. I'm still curious about that part of you."
<Page8>
 All this after only two tardies?
 The though of being late again makes me shudder. 
 Next time, I'll definitely be more punctual.
<Page9>
"O-Oh, I suppose those assumptions made you angry and think I hated you, right?"
"Hate me... you're right, I guess.
 I've never talked to anyone like this, so I don't really know, but..."
 Arcueid glances over with a serious look on her face, then―
<Page10>
"So...
 Shiki, do you hate me?"
 What a ridiculous thing to ask.
<Page11>
"――――――, #Idi―"
 The surprise almost makes me stop thinking, but this was the main gate of the Tono residence.
 It's the middle of the day, the sun is shining brightly, and I'm used to surprise attacks after the incident when I woke up.
 So then, 
<Page12>
"Don't be silly. I don't like you or dislike you.
 Although, what you would do if I said I didn't like you? Just walk away?"
"? I'd make you cooperate however I could, right?"
<Page13>
"Hey, look. Like or dislike, it doesn't matter.
 Emotion and purpose are different. That's what cooperation is all about."
<Page14>
 Okay, she seems to have been convinced by my explanation.
 Arcueid is a rational thinker by nature.
 She must have been so angry last night that she asked me such a question.
<Page15>
 ......I have no choice.
 Today, I'll listen to her selfishness as much as I can without endangering my life...
