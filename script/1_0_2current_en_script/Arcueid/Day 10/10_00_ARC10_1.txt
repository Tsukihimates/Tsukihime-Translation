<Page1>
I wonder if the... window has been left open.
I could hear the birds chirping from outside. 
<Page2>
A chilly breeze hit my cheeks. 
Pale sunlight rested on my eye lids. 
Quiet, gentle shades of the surroundings. 
I felt the soft morning coming on. 
Unconsciously, I picked up my glasses from my bedside table. 
<Page3>
...I see. 
I fell asleep last night after talking to Akiha. 
My fists are slightly heavy, but I'm still better than last night. 
<Page4>
"Good." 
I said to inspire myself. 
I opened my eyes and decided to greet the morning with a clean slate. 
<Page5>
"Ah. You're finally awake, what a guy." 
But. 
When I opened my eyes, there was Arcueid's face. 
<Page6>
"――――――" 
I was blown out of my thoughts by how much had happened. 
It's so white, it's as if my brain has turned to tofu. 
My mouth is frozen, forgetting to even breathe. 
<Page7>
Seriously, I don't know what's going on. 
Arcueid was right in front of me. 
This is my room. 
It was just after nine in the morning. 
In addition, all I know is that Arcueid is on the bed in her boots. 
<Page8>
"Oh, oh, oh, youuu." 
"Liar. You promised I'd see you tomorrow." 
<Page9>
Arcueid’s red eyes were not as beautiful as they should have been, perhaps because she was in a bad mood.
―――No, I'm not losing it. 
The fact that I'm seeing her eyes so closely makes them seem more vivid and beautiful than usual. 
<Page10>
Arcueid is staring at me with a slight frown. 
That's very close. 
<Page11>
A state of proximity#where I could feel her breath, her body heat, and even the smoothness of her skin. 
The posture covered me as I laid flat. 
In martial arts, it's called being mounted. 
<Page12>
"Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Arcueid. 
Why are you in my room in the morning...?” 
<Page13>
I tried to yell at her but kept my voice as low as possible. 
If I shout out here and Hisui comes to my room, that's the end of it. 
Although I couldn't grasp the situation, I was able to comprehend that much. 
<Page14>
"And anyway. just go away for now....! 
You can't just barge into people's rooms and ride them while they're asleep and ignore their human rights! You're an invader, aren't you! 
<Page15>
"What's with that attitude? The reason I came here is because Shiki broke his promise. 
What the hell are you doing, keeping people waiting while you sleep all the time?" 
<Page16>
Arcueid glared at me. 
...Promises... Yes, promises. 
I must have broken my promise to meet up with Arcueid last night. 
<Page17>
"――――" 
Finally, I was able to understand the situation. 
I understood why Arcueid was so angry. 
<Page18>
I get it, but that doesn't mean this is okay. 
You can't seriously just skip a step and come to someone's room when you can just complain about it at the meeting tonight. 
The window was open, and it looked like someone had snuck in through it. 
<Page19>
"...Well, I broke my promise, so it's certainly my fault. But breaking into a person's house for that kind of thing is a bit much.” 
"This is not Shiki's house. 
Arcueid retorted. 
<Page20>
"And I was really more angry than I should have been. 
I waited and waited for hours, and when I realized that you had reneged on your promise, I was so mad that I surprised myself. 
I'm not going to let it go on like this, I'm going to get in there and grab you and rip your head off, I'm not going to let a few words get in the way of that. 
<Page21>
"It was a state of mind I'd never experienced before. 
I tried to stay calm, but the more I thought about it, the angrier and more heated I got.
Do you know what it feels like to be stuck in a bottomless swamp full of complaints about you, and the more you rage, the wider the swamp gets? I really felt like I was going nowhere. 
<Page22>
Arcueid's red eyes were full of frustration, protest, anger, and complaints about me, as if he still felt that way. 
"...Oh. You're right, it's irresistible. 
While he was ministering, he secretly checked to make sure his own neck was intact. 
<Page23>
"You know? So I couldn't take it anymore and snuck in, but Shiki was asleep, so I decided to wait for you. I wanted to at least hear your excuse. 
But Shiki, you don't wake up very often. I didn't have anything to do, so I just had to watch you sleep for a while." 
<Page24>
"...Yeah, Shiki's sleeping face was so quiet, it was scary. 
He was sleeping like a dead man, and I was afraid he would never get up. 
<Page25>
"...Huh. If you were worried, you should have woken me up. 
I'm much more worried about you being here than I am about that." 
<Page26>
"But I didn't want to wake him up. 
...I don't know how I look when I'm asleep, but if I could sleep like Shiki, I'd be happy. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation. 
When I did that, the feelings that had been welling up in me subsided, and then Shiki woke up.” 
<Page27>
"...So you've been there all night then, all this time?" 
<Page28>
"Yes. The people from the house came by a few times, but I made sure they couldn't find me, so I'm fine. 
Earlier, a girl came to wake Shiki up, but I didn't like her so I turned her away.
'Haha',  Arcueid laughs, smiling nimbly. 
<Page29>
Wait, what do you mean, "turn away"? 
"I'm not trying to be rough. See, I told you before that vampires have the mystic eyes of enchantment. 
I implied to that girl that Shiki had already gone to school, so she doesn't even remember me. 
<Page30>
"You're the one who said it wasn't memorable.... 
What a pushy person. 
...Well, it seems that Arcueid, in her own way, was concerned about my family situation.
<Page31>
"I now know exactly how it happened. 
...And I'm sorry about yesterday, Arcueid. 
It's not like that apology... but I will never break my promise to you again. I promise." 
<Page32>
He asserted, staring clearly into Arcueid's face. 
<Page33>
"Do you feel sorry?”
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ...I'm just realizing that the reprisals will be horrible." 
<Page34>
Lying on the bed, he gestured with his hands, saying, ‘I surrender’. 
Arcueid nodded her head in satisfaction, leaving me wondering where the grumpy look from earlier had gone.
<Page35>
Finally, Arcueid moved away from the bed. 
<Page 36>
"I can't believe you got on the bed in your boots. 
Don't you think it would be hard to wash the sheets if there were footprints on them?" 
<Page37>
I complained and pulled myself up out of bed. 
Arcueid was in the middle of the room, watching me lazily get out of bed. 
"...You know what? What are you doing?" 
<Page38>
"What? I'm waiting for Shiki to change his clothes. 
You can't go out dressed like that, can you?" 
<Page39>
"Well, I'm not sloppy enough to walk around in my nightgown... 
Wait, what did you say, Arcueid?" 
<Page40>
"Yeah, I was thinking of staying with Shiki for the rest of the day. 
You're going to make it up to me for breaking my promise, aren't you?" 
<Page41>
Arcueid said as if it were obvious. 
All day long, does that mean I have to skip school to hang out with her...? 
<Page42>
"What are you talking about? I have school to attend.” 
"What? You told me that you were sorry, but you're taking school over me.” 
<Page43>
"Ugh." 
That being said, I'm feeling weak. 
I glanced at the clock. 
The time was around nine o'clock in the morning.
<Page 44>
If I go to school now, I'll be late, and I'm also responsible for keeping Arcueid waiting all night. 
And well... if I confess for a moment, I too feel that it would be many times more fun. 
<Page45>
"All right, I'll stay with Arcueid for the rest of the day. 
But if we go out into the city in daylight, we won't find any clues, will we?" 
"Hmm? Don't worry about that part, okay? 
Because if you're just going for a walk in the city, it doesn't matter if it's daytime." 
<Page46>
"...What, aren't we going to be looking for vampires now that we couldn't do it last night?" 
<Page 47>
"Yeah, of course we’ll investigate at night. 
But it must be hard work for you to help me search for them all day, so I think it's okay to take a break for lunch.” 
"...That's a fair point, but just the two of us walking around town, that's..."
<Page48>
After so many nights out, isn't that what people call a date? 
<Page49>
As a vampire, Arcueid wouldn’t have such an idea, so she’d just say, ‘take me somewhere interesting’
From now on, I'm going to spend time with this her, normally, without killing vampires...? 
<Page50>
"What's wrong, Shiki? Your face is red." 
"―――――." 
In a panic, he hid his face with his hands and averted his gaze from Arcueid. 
"What?" 
<Page51>
...That's right, I've been alone with her many times before. 
But that was in an emergency situation, because we were framed as collaborators before we were men and women. 
So, no matter how beautiful I felt Arcueid was, I avoided being conscious of it. 
<Page52>
But if. 
If I just spend time with her, without any danger or purpose, I'm afraid I'll notice things I shouldn't... 
<Page53>
"Shiki? Hey, are you still going to school...?" 
"There's no way I'm going to... I said yes, so I'll go out with you. I said I wouldn't break my word. I don't know what kind of whim you're on, but I'm sure you can handle a walk around town. 
<Page54>
"...! Yeah, thanks Shiki! 
Let's get going then!" 
"......." 
What is 'thank you'? 
Arcueid bounced and walked to the window that seemed to be her entry point. 
<Page55>
"Hold on. I'll change in a minute, you can wait for me out there." 
"What, did you call me?" 
<Page56>
"Oh, I called you, but I didn't call you! I'm sorry to stop you, just stay outside. I'll catch up with you in a bit." 
"Yes, I'll be waiting for you at the main gate of the mansion. I've waited long enough, so don't make me wait any longer, Shiki. 
<Page57>
With a thump, Arcueid went out the window, as light as a cat. 
The trees in the garden swayed and swayed. 
<Page58>
Using the branches of trees in the garden as a foothold instead of the ground, she disappeared like a lithe cat. 
With the way he carried himself, it would be no problem for her to sneak into my room. 
<Page59>
"This is no time to be impressed with... 
I have to get out so Hisui doesn't see me." 
<Page60>
I change out of my nightgown and into normal clothes. 
After all, it was daytime on a weekday. I would be arrested if I walked around town in my school uniform. 
<Page61>
I opened the door a little and made sure the hallway was empty before moving on. 
Since I couldn't use the lobby, I went out the window of an empty room on the first floor to the garden.
