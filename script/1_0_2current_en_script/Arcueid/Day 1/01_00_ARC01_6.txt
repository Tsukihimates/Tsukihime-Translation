The girl leads me to the living room.
The living room, which I haven't seen in seven years, is so different in terms of scale that I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time.
<Page2>
I wonder if I've gotten too used to the Arima house, or if the standards here have risen in these seven years.
Either way, I feel uncomfortable as if this is someone else's house.
I start to look around the living room.
<Page3>
"Fufu.. You sure seem quieter than usual all of a sudden.
I understand how you feel, but please make yourself comfortable. This is your home, after all, Shiki-sama."
"Y-yeah, of course."
<Page4>
I hurriedly sit down on the sofa.
I just came back to my own house and I'm already overwhelmed by everything, it's almost pathetic.

The girl in the kimono moves the tea wagon located in the corner of the living room closer, brews a cup of tea, and brings it to me on a tray.

"Here, have some tea."
"Ah, thank you."

I can't help but feel embarrassed as she serves me politely with a smile on her face.

"I will go talk to Akiha-sama, please wait until then. #It will probably take about 10 minutes, so you may want to look around the house until then."
"You won't mind if I walk around on my own?"
<Page9>
"What are you talking about? This is your home now, there is nothing to be afraid of!
...#Ah, no, but you cannot go upstairs, Akiha-sama will be there."
<Page10>
But if it is on the first floor, please feel free to do whatever you like.
It has been seven years since you have been to this mansion. I am sure you are feeling nostalgic and excited."

She smiles mischievously.#"If you may excuse me."#The girl, who seemed to be a maid, bows and leaves the room.

She smiles mischievously.#"If you may excuse me."#Kohaku-san bows and leaves the room.

"......I give up."
The lavishly made living room made my muttering reverberate even louder.
Should I stay here and pass the time being nervous,
Or should I walk around the house?
I---
C:>Will wait here quietly.
C:>Will go for a little walk.
