Before that, I want to look around the hall a little more.
Even though it used to be my home, my mind seems to be in a state of flux by the sight of such a large mansion.
<Page2>
"Excuse me. Before we go to the living room, do you mind if I take a look around the other rooms? It's kind of nostalgic."
There used to be a playroom on the second floor of the west wing...
<Page3>
"Oh my. So you remember it."
<Page4>
"But, my apologies.
The large rooms such as the playroom, the library, and the salon have been locked since Akiha-sama became the head of the family.
Even if you are the eldest son, you are not allowed to use these rooms without her permission."
<Page5>
"Oh... I see. That's too bad."
She refuses me flatly, and I helplessly sweep my gaze away.
<Page6>
"I can't explore so freely after all, can I?"
"No, but I am sure she will allow you as soon as you greet her.
Ah, but---"
<Page7>
"It would be appreciated if you would ask permission first before entering a locked room.
The Tohno residence has strict security not only on the outside but also on the inside. If you enter an unauthorized room, I cannot guarantee your safety."
<Page8>
"My safety? Surely you're exaggerating. Are there going to be arrows flying at me?"
<Page9>
"No.
More terrifying than arrows would be the thunder of our strict master."
The servant smiles jokingly and urges me to go down the corridor.
I guess she wants me to go to the living room to rest first.
<Page10>
"Welcome back, Shiki-sama.
I look forward to working for you."
<Page11>
I can't reply to her polite greeting, so I follow her without hesitation.
