It's after school.
I couldn't bring myself to go back to the house right away, so I look out at the schoolyard through the window in a daze.
The classroom has been dyed orange by the setting sun. The color, like that of a still-wet watercolor red, hurts my eyes just a little.
<Page2>
I don't really like crimson red.
I feel nauseous as it seems to seep into the depths of my eyeballs.
...I'm weak against things that remind me of blood.
Or more accurately, I've developed a condition that has made me weak to blood.

Seven years ago, Tohno Shiki had a near-death experience.
I'm told that there was a terrible accident, and since I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, I was caught up in a collapsing building.//なんでも、ものすごい大事故が起きて、その場に居合わせていた俺は建物の倒壊に巻きこまれたという。
<Page4>
Originally, it seemed that the injury would be fatal, and everyone had given up hope. It was a sad state of affairs.
However, thanks to the quick response of the doctors and the fact that all the wounds were concentrated in one place, I miraculously survived.
<Page5>
...When I think back on it like this, it seems like someone else's story, and it's only natural that much of it feels made up.
One day, I unexpectedly got involved in an accident, was struck by an object which pierced through my chest, and eventually lost consciousness.
<Page6>
I was like a machine that had been forcibly shut down.
The rest of my memory was just painful and cold, and before I knew it, I found myself waking up in a hospital bed.
<Page7>
I still have the scars from that moment.
According to what I heard, not only did I land hard on my back when I fell, but a piece of glass had pierced my chest.
<Page8>
Thanks to that, I have a burn-like scar in the middle of my chest and back.
The first time I looked directly at my body after the wounds had closed, I passed out at the gruesome sight.
<Page9>
Since then, I've had frequent bouts of anemia and collapsed many times, causing a lot of trouble for those around me.
This is probably the reason why my father... Tohno Makihisa... left me at the Arima house, saying that I wasn't strong enough to be the heir of the Tohno family.
<Page10>
"...A chest wound, huh."
...I hold back the wave of nausea that came over me.
The pain is like a needle pricking my eyeball, but I take some deep breaths and push through it.
<Page11>
A mark of death in the middle of my chest, hidden beneath my uniform.
Since that accident, I've been able to see the 'lines'.
Thanks to the glasses that Sensei gave me, I have been able to live a decent life, but if I hadn't met her, I would've lost my mind a long time ago.
<Page12>
When we parted this morning, Keiko-san was worried that people in the Tohno house were different from the norm.
It's an unnecessary worry.
Because―――
If we're talking about abnormality, then I'm the one who's not normal.
<Page13>
"........."
I put my glasses back on and pick up my bag.
I can't stay in the classroom forever.
I'll―――
C:> Wander around the school.
C:> Return to the mansion.
