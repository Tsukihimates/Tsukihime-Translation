Suddenly, a question crosses my mind.
Why is she riding the train this early in the morning?
<Page2>
"But why?
Senpai, you're not a member of any club. Why heading to school this early?"
<Page3>
"Well, what do I have to hide? I'm on my way back from volunteer activities.
You see, the student council asked for volunteers to pick up trash in the park, right?
That's what I was doing until just now."
<Page4>
When she said that, I went, "Ah" and it all made sense to me.
Senpai is the kind of person who's always working hard for someone else.
<Page5>
"It was just an early morning volunteer activity for 30 minutes.
Everyone went back home for a while, but I thought I'd just go straight to school because heading home first would've been too much trouble."
Senpai's bag makes a clanking sound.
I thought it was a tool for club activities, but it seems to be a cleaning tool.
<Page6>
"Oh, do you want to see what's inside? You're so bold to check out your Senpai's belongings, even though you seem so innocent."
<Page7>
Senpai leans in closer as if staring into my face.
...Well, her face, her smell, and so many other things are so close that I'm not even sure where to look.
<Page8>
"No, no, it's not that, I just thought that if you have a foldable broom or a rake that would be unusual..."
<Page9>
"Hoh hoh, I see you also want to see my pruning shears.
All right. In that case, come by the tea ceremony club after school. You're more than welcome."
<Page10>
I felt embarrassed when she said that with a soothing smile.
Not being able to give a witty reply, all I can say is a weak "yes".
<Page11>
"It's a promise then. Between you and me, we have a surplus of snacks purchased with club funds. It's not something that stays fresh long, so I need a healthy boy to help out."
"I-is that so? Well, if my schedule permits, I'll certainly take you up on that offer.
Although getting taken in by food is something a cat would do."
<Page12>
Her smile is so friendly that I couldn't help but joke a little.
<Page13>
The green ribbon wearing Senpai spoke,
"It's more like a dog, I think.
I mean, felines are not good. The ones you can rely on to the end are the disciplined and intelligent canines!"
She looks pleased with herself and shows a determination that I couldn't quite understand.
<Page14>
Because our destination is the same, the conversation somehow continues.
We talked about last week's mid-term exams.
About the gymnastics festival, which was reduced in scale and only lasted one day.
About the cafeteria, where the menu has never changed.
About the controversy between the students and the school over the use of mobile devices, we both sighed, so we changed the topic and laughed about our impressions of a movie we had recently seen.
<Page15>
Fifteen minutes pass quickly.
Senpai is a good conversationalist, and rumors have it that she is "well-liked by both men and women".
<Page16>
I regret that we'd get to Souya Station in a few minutes, so I ask her what she wants to talk about next.
―――But.
<Page17>
"...Hey, you're making too much noise."
Just like that, we were unaware of our surroundings.
We both bow our heads to apologize.
"......"
<Page18>
"...We've made her angry."
"...Sorry.
I was laughing too loud, I guess."
<Page19>
After that, the conversation ends.
It is as though the friendly atmosphere we had experienced until just now was a lie.
Everyone is just a stranger, and a silence peculiar to the city dominates the train.
<Page20>
The train arrives at Souya Station.
It is just before 7 am.
It is a little early for school, and the city is still asleep.
The station is quiet now, but in an hour, it will be full of people and cars.
<Page21>
"There's not much traffic this morning either. It seems like the city is waking up late these days. I wonder if everyone is staying up late."
Senpai says something strange while carrying her heavy luggage.
<Page22>
"Um...can I take your luggage to school?"
Eh? Ah, no, no, don't worry about it. I have a stop to make, so I'll leave you here."
<Page23>
And so, waving her hand with a smile, Senpai runs off.
It is such a light and fast run that an onomatopoeic sound like "boing" would be appropriate.
I feel the urge to start running after her as though I didn't want to lose out to her. But there is no reason to hurry.
I'm going to head to school at my usual pace because I have to take care of my body.
<Page24>
...And then.
The girl from earlier comes out of the ticket gate.
<Page25>
She walks past me at a fast pace,
"You're as shallow as you look, aren't you? I'm disgusted."
and leaves behind a strong comment.
<Page26>
"――――――"
I am stunned by that sudden rebuke.
Apparently, I offended her.
<Page27>
From now on, I'll be more careful when talking on the train.
I may have unintentionally uttered a word that made people uncomfortable.
<Page28>
Well, even if you take that into account,
"...Man, middle school students these days sure are intimidating."
Giving such harsh critique while just passing by, it's like a samurai casually executing a peasant.
