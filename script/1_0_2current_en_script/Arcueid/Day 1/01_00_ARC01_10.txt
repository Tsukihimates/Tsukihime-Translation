---Suddenly, I wake up.
<Page2>
Without anyone waking me up,
Without hearing anything,
Vaguely without any reason,#I wonder when was the last time I woke up in the middle of my sleep.
<Page3>
I feel like I have forgotten something, so I sit up restlessly.
<Page4>
I feel my heart pounding, so I leave the room, curious about what is going on outside.
<Page5>
I am thirsty, so I go down the hallway in search of water.
<Page6>
A long, moonlit corridor.
The sounds of the night after the inhabitants have fallen asleep.
...How nostalgic.
I'm sure I've walked down a path like this before.
As though wandering lost, paying no heed to my surroundings, I begin to climb the stairs.
<Page7>
It is a blind spot in the mansion.
The staircase not only connects the first floor to the second floor but on the other side of the staircase, there is a secret passage that leads to the attic.
<Page8>
It has long since been forgotten, even by the residents.
The attic of the mansion, once used as a storehouse, has not been accessed by anyone for several years.
<Page9>
Even though it is October, it is as cold as the middle of winter tonight.
I search through the luggage for a blanket.
An old cabinet catches my attention, so I open a worn-out drawer to look inside.
<Page10>
"------"
There was nothing but a bunch of small, insignificant things inside.
The contents of the opened drawer rattled about.
<Page11>
The feeling of disappointment, as if I opened a treasure chest only to find a few pebbles scattered inside.
There are badges, accessories, binoculars, and other miscellaneous items collected by children lying around.
Among them, lay one item that clearly stood apart from the others.
<Page12>
It is a dirty bandage stored in a transparent plastic case.
It is neatly rolled up, but it's too old to be of any use.
There's nothing here.
Closing the drawer, I decide to go back to my room.
<Page13>
On my way out.
For no apparent reason, I notice that my cheeks are wet.
Maybe.
Maybe there was a time that I used this place when I was a kid.
