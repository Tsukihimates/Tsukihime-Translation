The main gate is tightly closed.
As a child, I had only thought of it as a large house, but after living with the Arima family, I realized how huge it really was.
<Page2>
The hills overlooking the city are all managed by the Tohno family.
The site is larger than our high school, and if you include the forest that spreads out behind it, it's probably three times as big.
<Page3>
The grounds are surrounded by a long wall and trees, making it impossible to see inside.
The main gate, which is the entrance to the property, is closed as if to deny anyone from coming in.
<Page4>
Next to the gate for cars, there is a doorway for people.
After a moment of hesitation, I press the button that seemed to be the doorbell.
<Page5>
Unlike a normal intercom, there was no ringing to be heard by the person who pressed the button.
After a few seconds of waiting, the doorway unlocks with a mechanical sound that says, "Please come in".
<Page6>
"...The door is fully automatic now. There used to be a guard..."
<Page7>
I open the heavy door and enter the premises, passing through the stone gate.
The door locks tightly behind me with a clunking sound.
<Page8>
After passing through the main gate, a gently sloping path leads deeper into the forest.
Surrounded by tall trees, the path reminds me of a tunnel.
It goes straight to the east, then after about 40 meters makes a right angle turn to the north.
<Page9>
"------"
With each step, memories come flooding back, as if being colored in.
I know this path.
I ran along this path many times.
<Page10>
Almost there.
Arriving at the corner and with my feet facing north, ---on the left, there lies...
<Page11>
The Tohno mansion, towering high, like a great wall of chalk.
Ah, I let out a sigh that could be described as both admiration and resignation.
<Page12>
It hasn't changed at all since then.
According to my father, the house was heavily renovated after the war, but the basic structure was inherited from my grandfather's and his grandfather's generation.
<Page13>
This is the castle of a powerful family who has been in this land for more than hundreds of years.
For Makihisa......no, even to the people related to the Tohno, this mansion is a sanctuary.
<Page14>
I remember at the annual family reunion, several adults would try to get my father to rent them a corner of the mansion.
<Page15>
They were probably successful businessmen with their own mansions, but for some reason they were obsessed with living here.
For them, living in this land must have been very prestigious.
......Really, how ridiculous. It's just a "luxurious mansion" to me who isn't used to the privileged class.
<Page16>
"...............Alright."
There's no turning back now that I've come this far.
There's an incongruous doorbell next to the double doors.
<Page17>
I shake off my nervousness and push the doorbell.
There's no familiar ping-pong sound.
<Page18>
The heavy silence continues for a few seconds.
I hear the sounds of hurried footsteps coming from the other side of the door.
<Page19>
"Yes, I have been expecting you."
Despite its heavy appearance, the door opens lightly.
<Page20>
The slanting sunlight streaming in through the window made my eyes squint.
I prepared for this, but I still gasp and look around the vast lobby.
<Page21>
......It has an architectural beauty that overwhelms any visitor.
I feel as if I had been transported to a different country, a different time. The interior of the mansion is so dated that even the atmosphere is different.
<Page22>
Still, I'm in the familiar lobby of the Tohno residence.
<Page23>
As I stand there, a girl in anachronistic clothing greets me.
<Page24>
"Thank goodness. I was worried that you might be lost since you were so late.
If you had not made it here before sundown, I would have come to get you."
The girl wearing a kimono and an apron says with a gentle smile.
<Page25>
"Ah, no---"
I'm so bewildered by this unexpected turn of events that I can't speak coherently.
I'd assumed that the person waiting to welcome me would have be the rugged-looking butler who had been Makihisa's secretary.
<Page26>
"?"
The girl tilts her head gently, as if puzzled by my confused attitude.
<Page27>
"You are Shiki-sama, right?"
"Y-yes. Although, addressing me with a "sama" is a bit excessive."
<Page28>
"You are, right? Oh, please do not scare me like that again.
I was afraid I made a mistake again."
<Page29>
The girl in the apron presses her forefinger to her lips with a warning gesture, as if she is a mother scolding her child.
Apparently, she is seriously worried and angry. Even so, the smile remains on her face and the girl retains her warm composure.
<Page30>
......Kimono and apron.
She comes to greet me like this and refers to me with a "sama".
So, this girl is----
<Page31>
"Excuse me. Are you a servant here by any chance?"
"------"
The girl answers my question with only a smile.
<Page32>
"You must be tired, right?
Please do not hesitate to come in. Make yourself at home in the living room until Akiha-sama is ready."
<Page33>
The girl walks slowly, as if leading me.
She walks towards the corridor on the east side of the lobby, next to the grand staircase.
<Page34>
I believe the living room is just inside that hallway.
I---
C:>Decide to obediently follow her.
C:>Decide to stop the girl and ask for her name.
C:>......Well, I think I'll explore the mansion a little.
