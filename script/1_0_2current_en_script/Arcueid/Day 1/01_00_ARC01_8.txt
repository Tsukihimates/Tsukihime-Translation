I go to the second-floor lobby again.
The Tohno residence is divided into an east wing and a west wing with the lobby at the center.
<Page2>
If I were to give an analogy, it would be like a bird with its wings spread.
The lobby is the body of the bird, and the east and west parts are the wings.
One wing...is about the size of a small infirmary.
It is symmetrical, and I remember that the east and west wings have the same number of rooms.
<Page3>
"Shiki-sama, your room is this way."
<Page4>
Hisui, without going down the stairs, walks down the corridor in the lobby atrium towards the west wing.
Apparently, my room is on the second floor of the west wing.
<Page5>
The sun has already set outside.
A blue carpet# stretches across the corridor.
The white walls are reminiscent of castle walls.
A girl in a maid uniform is walking down this corridor while being bathed in warm orange lights.
<Page6>
"...It's like a fairyland."
My thoughts couldn't help but spill out of my mouth.
<Page7>
"Shiki-sama, do you have any questions...?"
"No, I'm just talking to myself, don't worry about it."
"......"
Hisui looks at me, bows, and then continues walking.
<Page8>
"......"
...I'm speechless.
I wonder how many times I've been speechless since coming here.
<Page9>
The floor is made of teak, which is considered a high-grade wood.
The ceiling is as high as three meters.
The room in the back is probably a private sunroom.
The room that Hisui leads me to is not by any stretch of the imagination the kind of room a high school student would live in.
<Page10>
"...Is this my room?"
"Yes. If you are dissatisfied, I can arrange a different room for you."
<Page11>
"No, I'm not dissatisfied, but it's---"
I think it's a bit too good for me.
<Page12>
"Shiki-sama?"
"It's okay, it's nothing.
I'll be happy to use this room."
<Page13>
"Yes. The room has not been altered in seven years, so there should be no inconvenience."
"......"
Well, in other words...
<Page14>
"...Hold on a minute.
This used to be my room seven years ago?"
"That is what I have heard. Is it not?"
<Page15>
Hisui tilts her head faintly.
...I'm glad.
It seems that this girl can show some emotions.
<Page16>
"Hmm...well, if you ask me, yeah.
I remember some of it, and I'm sure I did live here."
<Page17>
This room doesn't feel familiar at all but maybe that's what happens when you've been away for seven years.
<Page18>
"But I still feel uncomfortable. I've been living in a four-and-a-half-mat room until this morning, so it's like I've come to stay in a fancy hotel."
<Page19>
"I understand how you feel, but please get accustomed to it.
After all, you are the eldest son of the Tohno family from today onwards."
"...Well, yeah, that's true. I'll try my best to at least make my outward appearance something that won't get laughed at."
<Page20>
I put my bag on the desk and straighten my back.
It's going to be nerve-wracking, but I'll just have to get used to it.
I should at least try to relax in this room if nothing else.
<Page21>
"Additionally, all the luggage that arrived last night has been brought in, do you find any issues with it?"
"No, not really.
Oh, is there something I'm not allowed to bring in?"
<Page22>
"...No, you simply had a surprisingly small amount of luggage.
If there is anything you need, I can prepare it for you so please let me know."
<Page23>
"...I see. No, I don't really need anything for now.
I don't have much luggage to begin with. The only things I have in my luggage are that bag, these glasses, and..."
<Page24>
The textbooks in my bag and the precious white ribbon I've kept for a long time are all I have.
<Page25>
"Anyway, don't worry about my luggage.
A nice room like this is more than enough."
"...Understood,
In that case, I will be calling you again in an hour."
<Page26>
"An hour from now, you mean for dinner?"
"Yes. Until then, please make yourself at home."
<Page27>
Hisui still says that without an expression on her face.
But how do I pass the time here?
<Page28>
The clock struck six in the evening.
Normally, I would be in the living room watching TV or using my phone, but I seriously doubt that this house has a "casual gathering space".
<Page29>
"Hisui, let me ask you a trivial question.
Does this mansion have a television or Wi-Fi?"
<Page30>
"A television and Wi-Fi...?"
<Page31>
Hisui narrows her eyes faintly.
...It's a head-scratching question if I do say so myself.
I felt like it was wrong to ask whether there are basic modern entertainment in such a luxurious western building.
<Page32>
"...There are no such things in the living room. There is an entertainment room in the west wing, but it is locked.
The relatives who stayed here until the other day brought their personal belongings, but they took everything with them when they left, so there is nothing left."
<Page33>
"The relatives that Akiha kicked out....who was staying there and for how long?"
<Page34>
"Kugamine-sama's eldest son and his family occupied three rooms in the west wing on the first floor.
Touzaki-sama's third daughter along with their fiance occupied a corner room in the west wing on the second floor.
Kishima-sama's eldest son took a room in the east wing on the first floor.
They all lived here for about three years.
Other than that...I heard that the family doctor of the previous head, Makihisa-sama, was staying at the mansion."
<Page35>
"For three years? ...Hey Hisui, isn't that what they call freeloaders rather than guests?"
<Page36>
Hisui doesn't answer.
It seems that no matter what kind of people are staying here, as a servant, she couldn't give her personal opinion.
<Page37>
At any rate, it seems that the people who were staying here have moved out with their belongings. In that case, I'd better not expect that they left any souvenirs behind.
It is unlikely that Makihisa, who possessed an antipathy towards such vulgar things as modern entertainment, would have allowed people to use TV and internet freely.
The same goes for Akiha, who was disciplined by our father.
<Page38>
"---Well, it's not like I'm going to die without it."
And I have my phone anyway.
I take my phone out of my pocket and check the time and reception.
<Page39>
As a matter of fact, the signal is still there.
I am relieved to know that I have at least internet connection on hand.
...I don't know, it just seems more natural to be out of range in such an unrealistic mansion.
<Page40>
"........."
In the meantime, Hisui remains silent.
As the epitome of a servant, she does not say anything except what is necessary and what is asked of her.
<Page41>
As a person who is not used to having a maid, I feel uncomfortable with her doing so.
I'd like to somehow make her laugh, but it seems like it would be difficult to do so with a half-hearted effort.
<Page42>
"I remember there should be a library in the west wing of the first floor.
I'll see what I can find there when I'm free."
<Page43>
Hisui does not answer.
Her gaze, which was fixed on me, shifts slightly, as if she's staring into the empty space above. Like a cat.
<Page44>
"---Hisui?"
Hisui doesn't say anything.
And then, suddenly, she looks straight back at me.
<Page45>
"I think it is in Nee-san's room."
"What?"
...I raise my voice abruptly...
Well, I mean, it's...
<Page46>
"I was talking about the TV.
I remember seeing it in Nee-san's room once."
Hisui says as if recalling the events of a few years ago.
<Page47>
"Good, there's at least that much here...wait a minute.
When you say "Nee-san", do you by any chance mean Kohaku-san?"
<Page48>
"Yes. Nee-san and I are the only two people currently working in this mansion."
<Page49>
...Now that I think about it, they look very much alike.
Compared to the girl in the kimono, who was smiling all the time, the girl in the maid uniform is so expressionless that I could not connect the two as sisters.
<Page50>
"I see. She definitely looks like the kind of person who would watch a variety show."
However, I don't feel comfortable going to her room and asking her to let me watch TV.
<Page51>
"Sorry, please pretend that I never asked this question.
I'm going to live here from now on, so I have to follow the rules of this mansion anyway."
<Page52>
Besides, I wonder what kind of sarcastic remarks Akiha would make if I were to leisurely watch TV on the day I came back.
I'll become a hard-working student as expected of a member of the Tohno family.
<Page53>
"I'll stay in my room until dinner, so please call me when it's time. You have other things to do, don't you?"
<Page54>
Hisui nods, answering yes to my question, and puts her hand on the doorknob.
The door swings open with a faint creak.
She bows and then quietly leaves the room.
