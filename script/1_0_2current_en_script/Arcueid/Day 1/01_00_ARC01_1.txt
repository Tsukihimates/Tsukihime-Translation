<Page1>
The rail line above ground switches to an underground line without warning.
The train, spewing artificial light, moves through the darkness as if diving into it.
<Page2>
The sound of creaking vehicles.
Artificial lights passing by at regular intervals.
As the tremors of the seat overlap with the second hand of the clock, I think about the passage of time and space.
<Page3>
It's early morning, 6:33 am.
Half an hour has passed since I got on this train.
I can't go back anymore. All this time and distance is now keeping me apart from the family that took care of me for all these years.
How I accept this may be a measure of the depth of my compassion as a human being.
<Page4>
Do I think of them as being 'still that close'?
Or write them off as 'already so far away'?
<Page5>
I wonder which of the two I feel.
I think about it for a moment, and then realize I don't feel either.
<Page6>
I'm the only one on the eight-person bench, and the row facing me is entirely empty.
The only passengers are a man in a suit dozing off in the next row over, and a girl standing in front of the door.
Because it's such an early morning train, it's very lonely inside the train car.
<Page7>
Perhaps because I'm so absorbed in my thoughts, the sound of driving from outside the vehicle strangely doesn't register in my ears.
<Page8>
I vaguely imagine a spaceship flying through the dark void of space.
The noise of the cluttered outside world does not reach me.
All that's here is my own futile imagination, the sound of my heart pumping blood, and the memories of what had happened just an hour ago.
<Page9>
It was out of the blue.
"Tohno Makihisa has passed away.
Tohno Shiki is to return to the Tohno household at once."
The telegram from my original home, which I hadn't heard from in nearly seven years, was something to that effect.
<Page10>
I can't go against a decision made by the main Tohno family. I am still a student, and I rely on them for living expenses.
Since I felt like being stubborn, I decided to leave the morning of the day I had to return, rather than the night before.
<Page11>
I just wanted to stay as long as possible in the home I had been living in until now―――
Even though it was my family's decision, it was my way of showing respect to the Arimas, who had welcomed me, a person that they had absolutely no connection with, into their family.
<Page12>
"Thank you for the food. Today's breakfast was delicious, as always."
Before the sun had risen, I ate breakfast, left the table, and pressed my palms together in the room that had been mine.
<Page13>
It was a meager way to express my gratitude for all the years I had spent here, but if I left my feelings behind, I would leave feeling unfulfilled.
Life here was nothing but bright. That was all the baggage I needed to take with me.
<Page14>
When I left the Arima household, Keiko-san was the only one to see me off.
It was my own suggestion that I should be as quiet as possible so as not to wake the rest of the family.
<Page15>
"Thank you for everything you've done for me.
Please give my regards to Father and Miyako."
The person who had played the role of my mother for seven years――――had a terribly sad look in her eyes. I never thought I'd see her look like that.
<Page16>
"I know it will be hard living in the Tohno mansion, but be strong. You're physically weak, so don't be too reckless."
I accepted her words of concern with an open heart.
The past seven years have been truly peaceful. As long as I didn't cause trouble for the Arimas, I couldn't be happier.
<Page17>
"After seven years, I'm as healthy as a man can be.
Even though it looks like this, my body is rather sturdy, you know."
"Yes, you're right.
The Tohnos are very different from other families, but you never seemed to be afraid of them. Ever since you were a child, you've been so fearless that it amazes me."
<Page18>
At her words that mingle with a bitter smile, I smiled back.
I was glad that in Keiko-san's mind, I was still her child.
<Page19>
"You're overestimating my abilities.
...I'm off then. Take care of yourself, Mother."
"Yes, I will. Take care as well, Shiki."
It was typical of Keiko-san not to reply with something like 'Have a good day.'
She sent me off with tears in the corners of her eyes, having already accepted that I would never return.
<Page20>
That's what happened just 40 minutes ago.
It was a turning point in my entire life.
It was the beginning of a new life for me, and the end of Tohno Shiki's old one.
<Page21>
The scenery outside is changing little by little.
We must have passed through Yashirogi, a suburb across the river, and entered the urban area of Souya.
<Page22>
The train line emerges above ground again.
A sensation of gently ascending a slope.
My eyes, which had become accustomed to the artificial light, are stung by the sunlight as if being woken up.
<Page23>
The train rumbles on, providing a panoramic view of the city.
Most of the city is still sleeping.
Outside, the air is getting colder.
It is an autumn morning in October, a time when all traces of summer have disappeared.
<Page24>
Thinking about it, I've been gazing at this scenery for almost a year and a half.
This is the last time I will see this view on my train ride to school.
I think back on the past seven years, tracing the landscape as I pass by.
<Page25>
When I was ten years old, I recovered from a serious accident that should have killed me on the spot, //The JP text uses commas instead of periods on this page, I think it flows better with the short sentences.
Met Sensei,
Ended up living at the Arima household,
And finally, began the autumn of my second year of high school.
<Page26>
The special event that Sensei told me of when we parted never occurred, and as long as I wear the glasses she gave me, I won't see any lines at all.
I believe that I've been spending my days living a precious, yet ordinary life.
<Page27>
Starting today, however, things are going to get serious.
Although I'm only returning to my original home, I'd be lying if I said that I felt comfortable about it.
I've gotten so used to an ordinary house that living at a place like the Tohno mansion is going to be a big hassle for me.
<Page28>
"...To begin with,
I can't imagine a Western-style building bigger than my school..."
I'm amazed at the things I was able to endure as a child.
The mere thought of returning to such an anachronistic lifestyle makes me feel depressed, even if I don't feel anxious about it.
<Page29>
The train arrives at a large station and stops for several minutes.
Since this train is stopping at every station, I'll have to wait for the next rapid train to pass by.
<Page30>
There is no one else on the platform.
At this time of day, I would expect to see a few businessmen in suits, but this morning is particularly quiet.
<Page31>
An express train is passing by on the next track.
"Thank you for waiting. The next stop is―――"
I hear a familiar announcement.
The automatic door closes using pneumatic pressure.
There are only four stops left until Souya Station, where my high school is located.
<Page32>
"Awawa, wait, wait!"
<Page33>
"Ah, that was close.
I almost lost my head."
<Page34>
A female student from my high school slips in through the door.
She has a green ribbon, so she must be a third year student. She looks vaguely familiar.
The bag in her hand probably contains something for club activities.
<Page35>
"――――――"
Our eyes suddenly meet.
The upperclassman is staring at me.
Not only that, but she comes sauntering up to me.
<Page36>
"Good morning. I'm sorry for bothering you so early in the day."
"Ah, no, I'm sorry too. For staring at you, I mean."
The smile on her face made me apologize by reflex.
<Page37>
"No, it's my fault for doing something conspicuous.
I accidentally let you see an embarrassing side of your upperclassman.
But it's true what they say about not being good in the morning, right?"
<Page38>
Senpai chuckles.
I'm taken aback by her gesture.
<Page39>
"Look. It's me, it's me. I met you just last week, have you forgotten about me already?"
<Page40>
"Huh...  Ciel-senpai...?"
In an instant, my memory is jolted.
Of course, she looks familiar. I've met this person several times at school.
Actually, there's probably no one in our school who doesn't know Ciel-senpai.
<Page41>
At some point, she started to get called 'The Almighty Godfather Senpai'.
If there are first years who are troubled, she will counsel and help them feel better.
If there are second years who are lost, she will guide them herself.
If there are third years making trouble with other students, she will stop them from bullying their underclassmen.
<Page42>
Some students even call her the real student council president, since she's more dependable than the teachers and the school council themselves.
It goes without saying that when I ran into trouble last week, she helped me out.
<Page43>
...It's actually a bit of a blur.
I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a morning person, or because my head got foggy from the thought of going back to that home from seven years ago.
I...
C:>have nothing to talk to her about.
C:>have a few questions.
C:>should just carefully admire her, since I have the opportunity.
