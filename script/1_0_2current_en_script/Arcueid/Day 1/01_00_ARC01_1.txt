The rail line above ground switches to an underground line without a hint of warning.
The train, spewing artificial light, moves through the darkness as if it were diving into it.
<Page2>
The sound of creaking vehicles.
Artificial lights passing by at even intervals.
I superimpose the tremor felt through the seat on the second hand of my mental clock and observe the passing of distance and time.
<Page3>
It's early morning, 6:33 am.
Half an hour has passed since I got on this train.
That's how much time and distance has passed since I left the homes of the people who have taken care of me over the years and to whom I will never return.
How I accept this may be a measure of the depth of my compassion as a human being.
<Page4>
Do you think of them as being "still that close"?
Or write them off as being "already so far away"?
<Page5>
I wondered which of the two I feel.
I thought about it for a moment and I realized that I didn't feel either of those things.
<Page6>
I am the only one on the eight-person bench, and the row facing me is entirely empty.
The only passengers are a man in a suit dozing off in the next row over, and a girl standing in front of the door.
Because it is such an early morning train, it is very lonely inside the train car.
<Page7>
Perhaps it was because I'm so absorbed in my thoughts, but the sound of the drive from outside the vehicle strangely doesn't register in my ears.
<Page8>
I vaguely imagine a spaceship going through the dark void of space.
The noise of the cluttered outside world does not reach me.
All that's here is my own futile imagination, the sound of my heart pumping blood, and the memories of what had happened just an hour ago.
<Page9>
It was out of the blue.
"Tohno Makihisa has passed away.
Tohno Shiki is to return at once to the Tohno household."
The telegram from my family home, which I hadn't heard from in nearly seven years, was something to that effect.
<Page10>
I can't go against a decision made by the main Tohno family. I am still a student, and I rely on them for living expenses.
It was a little stubborn of me that I chose to leave the morning of the day on which I was to return, rather than the night before.
<Page11>
I just wanted to stay as long as possible in the home I had lived in until now...
Even though it was my family's decision, it was my way of showing respect to the Arimas, who had welcomed me, a person that they had absolutely no connection with, into their family.
<Page12>
"Thank you for the food. Today's breakfast was delicious as always."
Before the sun had risen I ate breakfast, left the table, and pressed my palms together in the room that had been mine.
<Page13>
It was a meager way to express my gratitude for all the years I had spent here, but if I left my feelings behind, I would leave feeling unfulfilled.
Life here was nothing but bright. That was all the baggage I needed to take with me.
<Page14>
When I left the Arima household, Keiko-san was the only one to see me off.
It was my suggestion that we should be as quiet as possible so as not to wake the rest of the family.
<Page15>
"Thank you for everything you've done for me.
Please give my regards to Father and Miyako."
The person who had played the role of my mother for seven years ---- had a terribly sad look in her eyes. I never thought I'd see her look like that.
<Page16>
"I know it will be hard living in the Tohno mansion, but be strong. You're physically weak, so don't be too reckless."
I accepted her words of concern with a simple smile.
The past seven years had been truly peaceful. If the time I spent there hadn't caused trouble for Arimas, I couldn't have been happier.
<Page17>
"After seven years, I'm as healthy as a man can be.
Even though it looks like this, my body is rather sturdy, you know."
"Yes, you're right.
The Tohnos are very different from other people, but you never seem to be afraid of them. Ever since you were a child, you've been so fearless that it amazes me."
<Page18>
I laughed at her words with a wry smile, which made her laugh as well.
I was glad that in Keiko-san's mind, I was still her child.
<Page19>
"You're overestimating my abilities.
......I'm off then. Take care of yourself, Mother."
"Yes, I will. You take care too, Shiki."
It was typical of Keiko-san not to reply with something like "Have a good day."
She sent me off with tears in the corners of her eyes, having already accepted that I would never return.
<Page20>
That's what happened just 40 minutes ago.
It was a turning point in my entire life.
It was the beginning of a new life for me, and the end of the old life of Tohno Shiki.
<Page21>
The scenery outside is changing little by little.
We must have left the suburbs of Yashirogi, separated by the river, and entered the urban area of Souya.
<Page22>
The train line goes above ground again.
The sensation of gently ascending a slope.
My eyes, which had become accustomed to the artificial light, are stung by the sunlight.
<Page23>
The train rumbles on, providing a panoramic view of the city.
Most of the city is still sleeping.
Outside, the air is getting colder.
It is an Autumn morning in October, a time when all traces of summer have disappeared.
<Page24>
Thinking about it, I've been gazing at this scenery for almost a year and a half.
This is the last time I will see this scenery on my train ride to school.
I think back on the past seven years, tracing the landscape as I pass by.
<Page25>
When I was ten years old, I recovered from a serious accident that should have killed me instantly.
I met Sensei.
Then, I ended up living at the Arima household.
And so the Autumn of my second year of high school has arrived.
<Page26>
Nothing special happened like Sensei said, and as long as I wear the glasses she gave me, I don't see any lines.
I have spent my days as an ordinary person, but I think I've lived a good life.
<Page27>
Starting today, however, things are going to get serious.
Although I'm only returning to my original home, I'd be stretching it if I said that I felt comfortable about it.
I've gotten so used to an ordinary house that living at a place like the Tohno mansion is going to be a big hassle for me.
<Page28>
".......To begin with,
I can't imagine a Western-style building bigger than my school......"
I'm amazed at the things I was able to endure as a child.
The mere thought of being returned to such an anachronistic lifestyle makes me feel depressed, even if I don't feel anxious.
<Page29>
The train arrives at a large station and stops for several minutes.
Since the train stops at every station, I was waiting for the next rapid train to pass by.
<Page30>
There is no one else on the platform.
At this time of day, I would expect to see a few businessmen in suits, but this morning it's particularly quiet.
<Page31>
An express train is passing by on the next track.
"Thank you for waiting. The next stop is---"
I hear a familiar announcement.
The automatic door closes using pneumatic pressure.
There are only four stops left until Souya Station, where my high school is located.
<Page32>
"Awawa, wait, wait!"
<Page33>
"Ah, that was close.
I almost lost my head."
<Page34>
A female student from my high school slips in through the automatic door.
She has a green ribbon, so she's probably a third year student. She looks vaguely familiar.
The bag in her hand probably contains something for club activities.
<Page35>
"------"
Our eyes suddenly meet.
The upperclassman is staring at me.
Not only that, but she comes sauntering up to me.
<Page36>
"Good morning. I'm sorry for bothering you."
"Oh, no, I'm sorry too. I was staring at you."
The smile on her face made me apologize.
<Page37>
"No, it's my fault for doing something conspicuous.
It was an embarrassing behaviour for an upperclassman.
But it's true what they say about being vulnerable in the morning, isn't it?"
<Page38>
Senpai chuckles.
I am taken aback by her gesture.
<Page39>
"Look. It's me, it's me. I met you just last week, have you forgotten me already?"
<Page40>
"Huh, ......Ciel-senpai......?"
In an instant, my memory is jolted.
Of course she looks familiar. I've met this person several times at school.
Actually, there's probably no one in our school who doesn't know Ciel-senpai.
<Page41>
I'm not sure who started calling her by this name, but she's known as the All-in-one senpai of Yakou.
If there are first years who are troubled, she would counsel and help them feel better.
If there are second years who are lost, she would guide them herself.
If there are students in trouble with the third years, she would stop them from bullying their underclassmen.
<Page42>
Some students even call her the real student council president, because she is more dependable than the teachers and the school council.
......It's actually a bit of a blur.
<Page43>
...... It's actually a bit of a blur.
I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a morning person, or because I haven't been home in seven years.
I...
C:>Sadly, there's nothing to talk to her about.
C:>I have a few questions.
C:>I have no choice but to watch her carefully.
