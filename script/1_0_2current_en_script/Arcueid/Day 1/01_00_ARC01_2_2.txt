―――Let's stay in the classroom and see what happens.
What can I say? I'm too lazy to move my body.
I am hungry, and I know I need to eat, but it's no use if I don't have anything for lunch.
<Page2>
I think Arihiko said something about that, but that's it.
Right now, I just want to sit deep in my chair and take a break.
<Page3>
"Ah, good, You're still in class."
"?"
I hear an unfamiliar voice nearby.
I turn around to see if they were talking to me.
<Page4>
"You didn't go to the cafeteria with Inui-kun, did you?
I almost went to look for you."
"I don't have much of an appetite.
Besides that, did something happen, Yumizuka-san? Calling out to me like that, is it something serious?"
<Page5>
I'm not really a friend of Yumizuka's, just a classmate.
It's rare for her to approach me face to face, let alone when I'm chatting with Arihiko like this morning.
So, I assume that she has some urgent business that she has to rely on me for.
<Page6>
"...W-well, it's no surprise that you would think that, with the way I've been until now..."
Yumizuka looks away awkwardly.
It is only for a moment, and she soon returns to her normal cheerful expression.
<Page7>
"Habano-sensei was looking for you. He said he wanted to talk to you about your place of residence."
"? What about my residence, is it about my move?"
<Page8>
Habano-sensei is the head teacher of the school.
Since Toyama-sensei was absent, he might have wanted to talk about that.
<Page9>
"Thank you, I'll be right there.
...But that's weird. I completed the procedures to change my address yesterday."
<Page10>
"――――――"
I force my sluggish body to stand up.
Yumizuka stares at me motionlessly.
<Page11>
"Is there anything else?"
"Huh? N-no, there's nothing else, really!"
"........"
I wonder if Yumizuka is feeling sick as well.
<Page12>
After all this time, Yumizuka Satsuki is one of the central figures in our class.
She's cheerful, easy to get along with, hardworking, and it's clear that she cares more about those around her than herself.
<Page13>
I think most of the boys like her, and there are no bad rumors about her among the girls.
Naturally, there is always a crowd of people around Yumizuka.
She is the opposite of me, who is not very sociable, and is a well-liked mood-setter.
<Page14>
Although we're in the same class in our second year, we've exchanged only a few words.
To be honest, I am surprised that she remembers my name.
<Page15>
"Tohno-kun. I was wondering if I could ask you something."
"Sure. What?"
<Page16>
"...Sorry if this is a weird question.
You just said you're moving, but are you going somewhere else, Tohno-kun? Maybe you're changing schools?"
<Page17>
"-Ah."
When she asked that question, I understood.
Her question is both plausible and misguided.
<Page18>
"No, it's just a change of address, and I'm only moving to Souya. It's not a big change.
This is a good school, I wouldn't want to transfer out."
<Page19>
"Y-yeah, that's right! We had a tough entrance exam! I studied very hard for it!"
R-right.
Although, for someone like Yumizuka, I thought a school like this wouldn't be very challenging.
<Page20>
"...Ah. But Tohno-kun, if you're changing address, are you going to leave Arima-san's house?"
"Yeah, that's right. It's a shame to leave, but I can't stay in their care forever-"
<Page21>
No, wait a minute.
I'm sure only Arihiko knows that I've been taken care of at the Arima house.
<Page22>
"I'm sorry. Did I ever tell you about this?"
"Of course. You told me this story. It was a long time ago, though."
"I see. I don't know what to say about that."
<Page23>
I must have had nothing else to talk about.
I can't remember exactly when it happened, but if Yumizuka and I had ever talked like this, I'm sure I would have had trouble finding a topic and slipped up.
<Page24>
"Well, I'd better get going. Is Habano-sensei in the staff room?"
"Yes, he said he would deduct points if you didn't show in ten minutes. I always wonder why they deduct points for things like that."
<Page25>
Yumizuka laughs awkwardly, without any sarcasm or irony.
I couldn't help but laugh as well.
The head of the school has a habit of saying "I'm going to deduct points" but there's no way that any evaluation can remove points for bad behavior nowadays.
<Page26>
"By the way, what are you going to do for lunch?"
"I'll drop by the cafeteria on my way to the staff room. Arihiko will be there after all."
"I-I see. See you later, Tohno-kun."
Waving awkwardly, Yumizuka leaves for her familiar group of girls.
<Page27>
After answering Habano-sensei's...difficult questions about my relationship with the Tohno family as succinctly as I could, I go to the cafeteria.
<Page28>
The cafeteria is busy again today. Most of the tables are occupied, if not full.
<Page29>
Only about a third of the students use the cafeteria, and those who are worried about how much money they have left in their wallets run to the cheaper school store.
Arihiko and I sit down at a table, watching the other students line up with meal tickets in their hands.
