<Page1>
In contrast to the white living room, the private room is red.
<Page2>
A luxurious curtain. A crimson carpet without a single stain.
The air is heavy and dignified as if giving the impression of the long history that it contained.
This is the office... of the head of the Tohno family, where Tohno Makihisa used to sit, and now home to Tohno Akiha.
<Page3>
"I have brought Shiki-sama with me."
"Thank you. You can go back to work, Kohaku."
"Yes. If you will excuse me."
<Page4>
The maid's name is Kohaku, then.
She gives me a small bow and leaves the room.
The only ones left are myself and ---two girls that I don't recognize.
<Page5>
She gives me a small bow and leaves the room.
The only ones left are myself and ---two girls that I don't recognize.
<Page6>
"It has been a while, Nii-san."
The girl with long black hair says these words with a dignified look in her eyes.
<Page7>
"------"
My mind is completely blank.
My thoughts have stopped entirely.
<Page8>
I can't even greet her properly, and I can only respond with an "Ah" and nodding my head.
I feel rather pathetic to be discouraged over it but I think it can't be helped.
The Akiha before me now looks very different from the one I knew seven years ago.
<Page9>
"...Nii-san? Is there something wrong in this room?"
As if carefully observing the visitor who is acting strangely, the black-haired girl squints faintly.
<Page10>
"Ah, ---no."
I couldn't think straight yet, and can only reply with dumb words.
I'm trying my best to recognize the girl in front of me as Akiha, but she seems to have already recognized me as her brother.
<Page11>
"---Sigh. I have only heard the stories, but it seems to be true that your physical condition is quite unstable. While it is time poorly spent, would you rather rest before we talk?"
...And then.
Akiha's words seem to have a certain sting to them.
<Page12>
"N-No, I'm not feeling that bad. I was just surprised at how much you've changed."
<Page13>
"...Thing change after seven years. That's what it means to grow up. Or did you think things would always stay the same, Nii-san?"
"No, it's---"
I'm so overwhelmed by her subtle pressure that I can't speak properly.
<Page14>
...Or rather, I started to reflect on everything.
I hadn't imagined what the current Akiha would be like.
I didn't think beyond my convenient memories of her that I had as a child.
I wonder how the seven years have made Akiha grow. Ah, but it's too rude to think about this in front of her.
<Page15>
"...I'm ashamed. To be honest, I didn't think it through.
But then again, you've changed. You're a lot more beautiful than you used to be."
I give my honest opinion.
<Page16>
"Thank you very much.
Although Nii-san hasn't changed much since back then."
Akiha says coldly with her eyes closed.
<Page17>
"........."
...Well, I was prepared for this, but...
It seems that Akiha doesn't think well of me after I left the Tohno family.
<Page18>
"......"
"------"
<Page19>
The silence lasts only a few seconds, as each of us tries to figure out what the other will do.
I can't think of a casual greeting to say to my sister whom I've reunited with.
Akiha is observing me as if I were a stranger, although I suppose I really am a stranger to her.
<Page20>
"...Well, that is fine.
If you are feeling well, then let us continue our conversation.
Have you heard any details about your move?"
<Page21>
"No, I don't know anything about it. I just heard that "You should come back to the mansion." I only read about the death of the old man in the newspaper."
<Page22>
When the head of a business group passes away, it is covered in the newspapers.
Even if there is no news from relatives, a disowned son can learn of his parents' death from such sources.
The news of Tohno Makihisa's death was delivered to the Arima family after his funeral as if I were a stranger.
<Page23>
"...You have my apologies. It was my fault for not informing you about father."
<Page24>
Akiha quietly bows her head.
Her smooth black hair is beautiful, ...but now is not the time to be admiring it. I shouldn't have said that earlier.
<Page25>
"You don't have to worry about that.
It's not like the dead would have come back to life even if I had come. On the contrary, I'm glad I didn't meet any of my relatives."
Being disowned puts you in a complicated position in many ways.
<Page26>
"...I see.
It makes me feel a little better to hear you say that."
<Page27>
The same goes for me, having a sister as frank as her.
A funeral is a ritual for those who can't forget the deceased to lay their feelings to rest.
For a son and a father who had severed their ties,
I can't think of a single reason to say goodbye to Tohno Makihisa. I have neither the right nor the duty to see him off.
<Page28>
"But then, who called me back?
It's not like it was in his will, right?"
<Page29>
"It was my decision to bring you back here, Nii-san.
It would be strange for the eldest son of the Tohno family to be kept in the Arima house forever, would it not? No matter what your defects are, you are still a Tohno."
<Page30>
"......"
The word "defect" came naturally to me.
I've been told that by the old man for years.
I don't feel any dissatisfaction or antipathy at being told this now, and her assessment is absolutely correct.
<Page31>
"Now that father... that Tohno Makihisa is dead, the only ones alive with the Tohno bloodline are you and me, Nii-san.
That blood must be protected.
I do not know what father had in mind when he entrusted you to the Arima family, but he has passed away.
As long as the reason is unknown, it is only natural for the current family to supervise Tohno Shiki here."
<Page32>
Akiha's words are calm but compelling.
It is as if she is declaring in advance that she won't listen to any of my complaints or protests.
<Page33>
"...Supervision, huh. So what would have happened if I had refused to come back to the Tohno house?"
<Page34>
"You do not have the freedom to decide that. No one from the Arima branch has the right to refuse a decision from the head family.
You and I were both raised by the Tohno family. At least until you reach adulthood and become independent in society, you are obligated to be a slave to the Tohno family."
<Page35>
"........."
That's what Makihisa said too.
Parents have a responsibility to raise their children and send them off as members of society.
<Page36>
A family is just the smallest size of a 'company' that together constitutes a nation, and as a company, you mustn't ship defective products.
This doesn't only damage the name of the family but also lowers the quality of the whole country.
<Page37>
Those who cannot take on that responsibility are not qualified to be parents, and children who cannot live up to that responsibility have no reason to be part of a family.
Tohno Makihisa told this story to me and Akiha many times. It was as if he was reassuring himself, over and over again.
<Page38>
"That's what the old man used to say.
So the reason you called me back is simply..."
It's not for the feelings of her brother who was disowned by their father.
<Page39>
"It is because no matter how you put it, you are the eldest son of the Tohno family.
Do you not think that is enough of a reason?"
As the head of the Tohno family, she is just cleaning up a matter that had been left unattended.
<Page40>
"I am glad you understand.
Needless to say, you should take my words as those of the head of the Tohno family. You are my brother in the family register, but it'll be completely different when it comes to hierarchical relationships in this family."
<Page41>
"Nii-san. I respect you as my brother, but at the same time, as the one who is in charge of this house, I will treat you as the property of the Tohno family.
Please forget about what happened seven years ago and engrave into your mind that I am the head and you are part of the family."
<Page42>
Akiha's voice is indifferent.
A decision is made from above. It is true that I feel something cold there.
But---
<Page43>
"Yeah, I understand when you put it like that.
I feel more at ease when I hear it from you straight."
This is a natural outcome.
It's nothing to be upset about.
<Page44>
"...You understood what I was saying?
But I was going to make a one-sided declaration for you to comply from a position higher than yours..."
<Page45>
"I know, and I'm not complaining. I mean, I'm going to be treated this way no matter what I think about it.
In fact, I'm grateful to you for treating me as your brother after I lived for seven years as I pleased."
"....................."
<Page46>
"But regardless of what you think, didn't the relatives object? Weren't they the ones who suggested that I stay at the Arima house?"
<Page47>
"Yes, they did. But I am the current head of the family. I rejected all of their advice.
I have made it clear that to interfere in this matter is to go against me, and by extension, against the Tohno family."
<Page48>
"------"
I can't help but look at her in amazement.
Even Makihisa couldn't reject the branch families. But for Akiha to persuade all of them... no, maybe she argued them down.
...Yeah.
She has grown up well in appearance, but I wonder how much she has grown up inside as well. As the older brother, I'm a little scared of my sister's rapid development.
<Page49>
"...Nii-san?
You have a distant look on your face. Is something wrong?"
<Page50>
"Oh, no, I'm impressed, or rather, moved... you've really been recognized as the head of the family."
"Of course. Otherwise, I would not be able to call you back, Nii-san."
<Page51>
"Back to the matter at hand.
From today on, you will be living in the mansion, but there are rules and regulations here. You will refrain from misbehaving as you have in the past, so please keep that in mind."
<Page52>
"Huh? Haha, that's impossible, Akiha.
There's no way I can go back to being a well-behaved person now, and I have no intention of trying to either."
<Page53>
"No, you will turn back no matter what.
You are not a child, so do not whine before trying.
Or are you implying that you are unable to do the things that I can do?"
She glares at me with a cold stare.
<Page54>
"------"
Or rather, her gaze is more like a piercing spear.
"Uh..."
There's no doubt about it. I'm now being mercilessly bombarded with the animosity that has been piling up for seven years...
<Page55>
"...Okay. I'll try as hard as I can."
"You'll try? That is a convenient response.
Do you think that anyone who makes an effort will be rewarded? I only thing I am looking for is results, that is all."
<Page56>
"Ugh....."
I'm completely dumbfounded by her not having even a millimeter of kindness.
<Page57>
"... Fine. You have been living a free and easy life until now, so I do not expect you to change it immediately.
I will give you a week at the earliest and a month at the latest, so try like your life depends on it."
<Page58>
I hold back the thought that this seems more like being put on probation than being let off the hook.
Akiha is making a compromise in her own way. I'm sure.
<Page59>
"...You know what? It is not as difficult as it may seem.
You and I are the only ones living in the mansion now.
It is hard for you to relax with all those noisy relatives around, and it is a nuisance for me too, so I sent them away."
<Page60>
"---"
Wait a minute... You don't mean...
"You got rid of all the relatives staying in the mansion?" #I didn't know she could do that...!
<Page61>
"Yes, please do not worry about it.
They are merely people who had lost their home and property, and were leeching off father's generosity without making any effort. Sooner or later, we were going to ask them to leave the house.
Oh, I have let most of the servants go, but I have left one for each of us, so there is no problem."
<Page62>
"No, that's way too much! If you do anything like that, you'll be brought up for questioning at the next family reunion!"
<Page63>
"Please do not think too hard about it.
Would you not feel more comfortable if we were the only ones in the mansion than if it was full of people?"
<Page64>
...Ugh.
Well, it really does make me feel better...
<Page65>
"...No, but, you know, is that really okay?
Even the old man didn't go against the opinions of his relatives, despite how tyrannical and selfish he was..."
<Page66>
"That is right. That is why father entrusted you to the Arima family. But I have hated those people since I was a child. I do not want to listen to any more of their nonsense."
" "Their nonsense"? Akiha---"
<Page67>
"Oh for heaven's sake, there is no need for you to worry about me!
You should be worried about your own life from now on. It is obvious that you are going to have a lot of trouble going forwards."
<Page68>
Akiha said unpleasantly, forcing the discussion to a close.
<Page69>
"I am sure you understand the situation, but it seems that you still treat this as if you're living with the Arima family.
...Well, not that it matters. I have a servant for that purpose.
If you have any questions in the future, you can ask her.
----Hisui."
<Page70>
Without turning around, Akiha calls out to the girl who was waiting in the corner of the room.
<Page71>
The girl, called Hisui, steps forward and bows to me.
It is an expressionless but polite bow, a crystallization of sincerity.
<Page72>
"This girl is Hisui, a servant of our mansion.
She will be your maid from now on, is that alright?"
I see, so she's a servant of the mansion... wait, what?
<Page73>
"Wait, by maid, you mean..."
"A personal servant would be a better description."
<Page74>
...I can't believe it.
As someone who looks the same age as Akiha, the girl in the maid's uniform doesn't show any expression, as if it's natural for her to do so.
<Page75>
"Wait a minute. Isn't it too much to have a personal servant? I can do my stuff on my own..."
"Even stuff like preparing meals and doing laundry?"
Akiha's point is relentlessly sharp.
<Page76>
"In any case, now that you have returned to this mansion, you will follow my instructions.
I do not know how you lived in the Arima house, but from now on you are living here as the eldest son of the Tohno family.
Please accept the appropriate treatment as your duty."
<Page77>
"Ugh..."
I sweep my gaze over the girl in the maid's uniform.
Hisui is still expressionless, just staring back at me like a doll.
<Page78>
"Alright then, Hisui, please guide my brother to his room.
It seems that this person is no different from a cat that does not know left from right. Do not let him get lost in this big mansion."
"As you please, Akiha-sama."
<Page79>
After bowing to Akiha, Hisui comes towards me without any hesitation.
Her line of sight is now directed at me, so I look all over the place so that our eyes don't meet.
... Her pace is gentle but not slow, indicating that she has been a servant for a long time.
<Page80>
"Oh, Nii-san.  Even as the eldest son, there are certain things that are forbidden in this mansion, like places that you should not enter. Please do not violate these rules.
I have also ordered Hisui to take care of you, so please listen to her advice as much as possible."
<Page81>
"That doesn't seem like being taken care of but more like being observed, don't you think?”
"If you live a proper life not breaking any rules, Hisui will be relieved of this role.
With that, I'll see you again at the dinner table."
<Page82>
It seems that Akiha has a full schedule and doesn't want to waste any more time.
<Page83>
"I will show you to your room, Shiki-sama."
Hisui heads for the door, unconcerned about my state of bewilderment.
"...Hah."
Sighing, I leave the office as well.
