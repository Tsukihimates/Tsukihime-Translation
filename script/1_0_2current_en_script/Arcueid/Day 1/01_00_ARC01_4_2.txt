...It's about my sister, Akiha.
<Page2>
In the beginning, when I was left at the Arima household, Akiha came to visit me several times.
Unfortunately, she couldn't see me often because I had to go to the hospital every day, and after she went to a boarding school, we only exchanged a few letters.
<Page3>
Unlike Akiha, I'm not a member of the main family.
That was why I was able to lead a free and easy life.
For the past seven years, I have had no contact with my sister.
<Page4>
To be honest, I have no desire to return to the Tohno mansion.
However, Akiha is there.
As a child,
Akiha was quiet, always timid as if she was holding something back, and followed me around anxiously.
<Page5>
Perhaps it was her long black hair and luxurious clothes, but Akiha seemed like a fragile girl as if she were a princess in a fairy tale.
Even though I have no right to act like a big brother now, I have been worried about Akiha for the past seven years.
<Page6>
So when I heard the news of Makihisa's death, my first concern was for her.
<Page7>
She lost her father and was left alone in that big mansion.
More than anything, I feel guilty for forcing the duties of the Tohno family on her and living a selfish life.
I think the reason why I agreed to come back to the mansion may have been to apologize to her.
