I think back to the incident with my father, Tohno Makihisa.
<Page2>
...I don't have any memories of playing with him though.
Makihisa was a strict father, but at the same time, he was a quiet man who didn't show his emotions.
<Page3>
Do not go out, do not go into the city, people are born with different statuses, protect our noble bloodline which should not be viewed as the same as the others―――
Those were the rules of Makihisa, and by extension, of the Tohno family.
<Page4>
I rebelled against those rules.
I felt that my father's teachings were wrong.
Not because of a mistake in logic, but because of a lack of persuasiveness.
...I'm not so sure now, but as a child, it felt like they didn't even belong in this era.//ruby dots <も|・><う|・><時|・><代|・><じ|・><ゃ|・><な|・><い|・>, for italics

Although I wasn't the only one who disagreed with Makihisa's words, I was the only one who could defy him face to face.
<Page6>
As a result, I began to ignore orders and would frequently escape from the mansion, which led to me getting involved in the accident.
'The world outside the mansion is ugly. It is poison to you.'
It's ironic.
Makihisa's warnings were true only for me.
<Page7>
After I woke up in the hospital, Makihisa never came to visit.
The last thing I remember was being ordered to 'go to the Arima house' the day I returned to the mansion after being discharged from the hospital.
<Page8>
Makihisa is no longer with us.
The fact that I don't feel any emotion about not being able to see my father before he passed speaks volumes on the relationship between us.
