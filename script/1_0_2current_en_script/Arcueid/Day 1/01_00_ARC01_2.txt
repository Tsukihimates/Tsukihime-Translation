I walk to school a little later than usual.
By the time I see the main gate, it is almost 7 am.
Students on their way to club activities are hurrying past the main gate.
They must be trying to use up the limited time they have until 8 am, the start of homeroom.
<Page2>
Tokyo Metropolitan Souya High School.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the old school.
It is an average high school with a moderate rate of advancement and extracurricular activities as well as reasonably loose school rules.
<Page3>
The only complaint from the male students is a very common one: "Please improve the outdated uniform design".
On the other hand, the female students' uniform was changed three years ago.
The school thought that the number of applicants would decrease if they had to wear the old-fashioned sailor uniforms, so they did the best they could to compromise.
<Page4>
"Hmm...?"
I feel a faint sense of discomfort in the familiar scenery.
This morning is somewhat hectic.
<Page5>
Teachers are running to the staff room with pale faces.
There is a black car parked in the parking lot that I have never seen before.
The sky is bleak.
For some reason, I imagine a funeral with no attendees or a black and white striped curtain that goes on and on.
<Page6>
...I sigh at my dark thoughts.
I decide to shake off my unpleasant premonition and head to the classroom.
<Page7>
I enter the empty classroom.
I sit down in my chair and kill time until the morning homeroom.
As I studiously dedicate myself to my prep work, the class begins to fill with people.
<Page8>
"Good morning. Today's morning practice is over."
"Huh, I'm not the first one here? You're pretty fast, Tohno."
"Oh, that's right, volunteers!"
"But is it actually today? Oh no, I might have skipped it!"
<Page9>
In class 2-C, the students get along better than in other classrooms.
They greet each other the moment they meet and then sit in their own seats.
<Page10>
The students who finished their club activities are talking with the rest.
Everything ranging from last night's Internet news, which has been consumed to the point where there is no room for debate, to the new information about school that happened just ten minutes ago is being discussed.
<Page11>
It might be just simple idle talk to kill time, but it's a necessary part of our routine.
It's a light warm-up before the day begins.
In this day and age of information overload, it would be exhausting for both us and the other person if we are to engage in serious dialogue all the time.
<Page12>
The atmosphere in the classroom suddenly changes.
What used to be a harmonious chat has turned into a whispering voice.
<Page13>
"Hey, don't block the road, assholes.
It's early in the morning and you're already swarming in and blocking the way."
Vicious words reverberate in the classroom as if to ignore the fact that classmates are present.
I don't need to see it to confirm it. The atmosphere in the classroom has changed because of the arrival of this―――
<Page14>
"Sup! Good mornin' glasses-kun!
You look so irritated this morning, you look like a piece of shit!"
"........."
It is the fault of this delinquent student that we strayed from the idyllic colors of our school.
<Page15>
"Hey, where's the greeting?
Someone goes out of their way to see you this morning, and you don't even say hello? Rather, don't you have any words to thank me for gracing you with my presence?
<Page16>
"No, I don't. It's just that I'm tired of seeing your overbearing face in the morning.
Besides, I have no reason to thank you. I didn't come to school for you."
<Page17>
"What? Don't be ridiculous! I came to school just for you! That's not fair!"
"........."
I'm speechless.
Sometimes I wonder why I'm his best friend.
<Page18>
Orange dyed hair and pierced ears.
He wears an anti-social attire that gives a bad image as if he is ready to fight with anyone at any time.
In this day and age when the culture of delinquent students has died out, he is a free-spirited outlaw who sells his way of violence.
That's him, Inui Arihiko.
<Page19>
"...Well, okay. It's a good thing to come to class in the morning.
Good morning, Arihiko. Are you finally starting to care about your attendance?"
<Page20>
"No, I'm not worried about that. There's still plenty of room for me to skip.#I've got my sister at home today, so I just can't slack off.
Besides, I've been staying up all night and I'm at the end of my rope."
"I see. My bad, let me redo my greeting.
Good night, Asshiko. Hurry up to your desk and get some sleep."
<Page21>
"Gee, what a cold reaction.
That's your attitude toward your rival from middle school? Can't you be more passionate about it!?"
<Page22>
"...Why do you and I have to be rivals?
If you want to live an unprincipled life, find some like-minded people on the street. Don't bother me too much."
No, I've lent him almost 10,000 yen since middle school and he hasn't given it back, so I can call him a foreign enemy at this point.
<Page23>
"I'm not sure why you're so cold only to me.
You're like a saint to everyone else, isn't it unfair?"
"What, didn't you already know?
There's nothing fair about the world."
<Page24>
"That's true, but...
But aren't you especially cold to me?"
<Page25>
Arihiko sighs exaggeratedly.
It isn't that I am being consciously cold to him, it is just that we have naturally come this close as a result of our mutual frankness without hesitation.
Although our interests and tastes are different, we are on the same wavelength somehow, I guess.
<Page26>
"...Well, there's nothing really wrong about running away from home.
But to think that a night owl like you would attend class so early in the morning, how did it come to that?
It's a bit, well, quite unusual."
<Page27>
"Yeah, I guess so too.
Just because you happen to be awake doesn't mean you should come to school. Honestly, I want to go home. Hmm, do students really need to have the motivation to study?"
<Page28>
He's certainly right, but when this man says it, I feel that it's admirable just to come to school even if you don't have the will.
<Page29>
"You can discuss that with the mirror the next time you're free.
What I want to ask you is why you don't just go to the city. Wouldn't karaoke or a manga cafe be a better way to kill time?"
"That's the thing. It's getting real dangerous out there these days.
I'm not breaking into a fight scene for free, and I'd only show up if I had the energy to begin with."
<Page30>
"Dangerous...?"
"Oh? Surely you would know about it. About that.
I'm talking about the case of the random killings that's been going around. Even the cops are patrolling around the city in front of the station at night.
"...I see. So there was a story like that."
<Page31>
I started to remember after hearing it from Arihiko.
The house I was staying at until yesterday is a few stations away from here, so the incidents around Souya station are somewhat foreign to me.
It should've been all over the news.
If I recall correctly―――
<Page32>
"What is it again? I know it sounds like a really vulgar sales pitch."
"The Midnight Street Killer Incidents, right?"
<Page33>
"A series of bizarre murders. The victims were usually young women, and a dead body, which was found two days ago, was the eighth. All of them have cross-shaped scars on their throats, too."
What the hell?
I can't even imagine a situation like that.
<Page34>
"That's wrong, Inui-kun. All the people killed lost a significant amount of blood."
<Page35>
I'm not sure if we are talking too loudly, but Yumizuka, who is nearby, pops up and corrects him.
<Page36>
"Ah, right, right. It looked like a modern-day vampire, didn't it?
Thanks, Yumizuka, good morning!"
<Page37>
"Good morning to you too, Inui-kun.
Oh, also, the trauma varies from person to person, with some having no scars at all and others having severe damage... I think."
<Page38>
"You know a lot, don't you, Yumizuka-san?"
"N-no, I don't!
It's a major case happening in this city, and if you watch the news, you're bound to remember it!"
<Page39>
"Well, that's how it is, Tohno.
Even for me, going out at night while there's a serial killer around is too much. I've been staying up late at home these days."
<Page40>
"Oh, so that's your reason?
I'm surprised you're so sane. It's not like you to stay at home scared of a murderer."
<Page41>
"It's not that strange, most people are scared of murderers.
I wouldn't even have the will to fight, not to mention the killer's thirst for blood or the possibility of a surprise attack. Hell no to that. I ain't throwing away my life just yet."
"...Oh, I see. You're right, if you're targeted, you'll have to fight to the bitter end."
<Page42>
"Come on man. Do I not even get a choice to run away?
Why would I have to fight to the death?"
"What? Escape isn't an option in that scenario, right?"
<Page43>
"Right, I was an idiot for asking you.
Actually, I don't care about the murderer either. You know, those are like natural disasters, right? It's bad luck to run into them.
The reason I don't go out into the city is more practical. Lately, there's been a new bunch of idiots in front of the north exit. To be honest, I don't even want to see their faces."
<Page44>
In front of the north exit...is a downtown area opposite the office district, and at night it's bustling with lots of people and traffic.
Arihiko also lives near the north gate, so if he's avoiding these "new idiots", they must be a pretty dangerous group indeed.
<Page45>
"Haven't you heard of them?
It's like a test of courage. You go into an underground passage through a secret entrance, and if you make it to the end, you win a lot of money, or so they say."
<Page46>
"I've heard of that too, but...isn't it just a ghost story?"
<Page47>
"Well, it's been an urban legend for a long time.
Those idiots have gone in and tried to turn it into some kind of scam. I don't know where they came from, but there's a terrible atmosphere around the north gate now. The slightest thing can kick off a fistfight."
<Page48>
"Basically, I don't want to get hurt, right? If they keep being so brazen, the police will step in soon, so I'll just stay indoors for a while until they're caught."
<Page49>
The urban legend of the north entrance... Unfortunately, I am not a local, so it is unfamiliar to me.
After today, it won't be a strange thing to me anymore... I think.
<Page50>
"Hey, what's with the lack of response?
It must be that, right? Did you collapse from anemia this morning?"
<Page51>
"No, I'm fine this morning.
It's nice of you to worry about me, but my body wouldn't be able to take it if I'm that anemic all the time."
"Yeah, I guess you're right. If you say you're okay, then you must be okay."
<Page52>
"Come on, class is about to start. Get back to your seat and go to sleep."
"Alright. ...Oh, yeah. For today's lunch, I will be in the cafeteria. I've invited a special guest to surprise you, so look forward to it."
<Page53>
Laughing as if he is planning something, Arihiko goes back to his seat.
<Page54>
"See you later, Tohno-kun."
"Ah, yes. I'm sorry for making you accompany me, Yumizuka-san."
With quick, light steps, Yumizuka returns to her seat.
<Page55>
Five minutes after the bell announcing the start of homeroom, our teacher, Toyama-sensei, still has not arrived.
Just as homeroom was about to end, the teacher next door comes in and announces that Toyama-sensei is absent.
<Page56>
"Woohoo! Today's math class is self-study!"
Someone in the class shouted in victory.
<Page57>
Toyama-sensei is the math teacher.
If he is absent, today's class will be self-study. The rest of the time can be used freely as long as we complete the assigned printouts.
Some students use it to study, some to play.
<Page58>
I start to work on my math problems.
When I was a child, I was told that it would be difficult for me to enter a prestigious school with my body, so I stopped going to cram school in middle school, but studying itself was still interesting.
Whether you go on to higher education or enter the workforce, having knowledge is not a waste.
After solving a few application problems, I look up and see the students in the hallway.
<Page59>
Since my seat is far away, I could only hear fragments of their voices.
<Page60>
"I knew it..."#"I can't believe it..."
"During the morning practice, the teachers turned pale as they entered the staff room..."
"It's still just a rumor."#"But for it to happen so easily."
"That's terrible, how did that happen?"
I furrow my brow, thinking that the worse my premonition is, the more likely it seems to come true.
<Page61>
"Yesterday's incident."#"There were two guys in the principal's office who looked like detectives."
I prepare myself for what is to come next.
It's something I'm used to, but I breathe in and wait for the words so that I don't dismiss it as something natural.
<Page62>
"So... Toyama, I heard he died yesterday."
I close my eyelids gently as if blocking out my headache.
<Page63>
The rumors about Toyama-sensei did not spread very far, and the morning class ends without incident.
<Page64>
It is lunchtime, and the classroom is in chaos.
Some are in the cafeteria, some are in the courtyard, and some are still in their classrooms spreading out their lunches.
Now, where should I have lunch?
C:>I'll meet up with Arihiko at the cafeteria.
C:>I'll stay in the classroom and see what happens.
C:>I'll figure it out in the hallway.
