I sit face to face with Akiha at the dinner table.
Hisui and Kohaku-san are fully focused on serving us.//　翡翠と琥珀さんは俺たちの給仕に専念している。
A master and their servants cannot sit at the same table.//　<主人|かじん>と使用人が食卓を囲む事はない。
...Naturally, since I'm used to harmoniously eating all together in the Arima household, it's an uncomfortable setup.//　……当然の話だが、有間の家の団らんに慣れていた俺にとっては、居心地の悪い夕食だった。
<Page2>
In addition, I have been letting my table manners atrophy.//　さらに言っておくと、俺は完全にテーブルマナーなんてものは忘れていた。lit. more like "had been completely forgetting my table manners"
Humans are experts in optimization and thus relegate unused memories to a corner of the mind. In that way, it wouldn't have made sense for me to remember my table manners.//人間とは使用しない記憶を頭の隅においやる、最適化の権化である。つまり、俺がテーブルマナーを覚えている道理がない。
<Page3>
It is a tense experience to see Akiha's eyebrows raise at every move I make. Truth is――it's thrilling.
...Honestly though, the thought of doing this every day is really depressing.
<Page4>
Dinner ends without any conversation.
I was so busy trying to remember my table manners that I didn't have time for any conversation.
And Akiha seemed to be completely displeased, as expected.
<Page5>
Hisui and Kohaku-san finish cleaning up the dishes, and immediately afterward...//そうして、翡翠と琥珀さんが食器を片付け終わった直後。
<Page6>
"―――It seems that thorough re-education is necessary."
She says firmly.
The devil's words, merciless in content and chilling in tone, reverberate across the dining room.//　内容も無慈悲なら口調も極寒な悪魔の一言が、食堂にコダマした。'chilling' actually should be modifying 'devil' but this reads much more cleanly despite being technically incorrect.
<Page7>
"―――For whom, and what kind?"
"For you Nii-san, I want you to have an appropriate attitude."
I knew it...
So that's what she was thinking while eating, with her shapely eyebrows twitching...
<Page8>
"...What exactly do you mean by that?"
"The first thing to do is to improve your lifestyle. Going out at night is naturally forbidden. The curfew is set at eight o'clock.
Whenever you go out for any reason, you have to ask permission from me, Kohaku, or Hisui."
<Page9>
"Wha...?"
Eight o'clock curfew? In this day and age? And even worse, I need someone's permission just to go outside?
"Wait, wait, that's..."
<Page10>
"I will be setting up a study schedule for your days off.
From what I have been told, your grades are completely average, are they not?//　報告によると兄さんの成績は中の中だそうですね。I believe 中の中 is like "the middle of the middle", "not of note"
...#My goodness. You are only good at cutting corners, efficient as ever."
"No way. I'm doing my best."//「とんでもない。俺はいつだって全力だ」does he yell "とんでもない"?
<Page11>
"Be that as it may, while you live in this mansion, I will have you take things seriously. Prepare for that.//「ですが、この屋敷にいる間は本気を出していただきますから、そのつもりで。"be that as it may" is much more 秋葉らしい
I know you are a person who can do it if you put your mind to it. Even taking your health into account, you should be in the top three in your grade, no?"//　兄さんはやればできる人なんですから、お体の事を考慮しても学年三位以内は当然でしょう」
<Page12>
My sister's overestimation stings.//　妹の過大評価が
And the thoroughness she used when researching my grades is frightening.//　あともう俺の成績をリサーチしている周到さが怖い。
<Page13>
"We will wait until you are a little more settled before we do anything else.
So before that, ―――Nii-san, please take out that thing."
"What?"
What 'thing' is she talking about?
<Page14>
"I am talking about that thing.
You have it, right? In your pants. That filthy thing is the symbol of youth.
I am telling you to stop hiding it and take it out."//　それを隠さずに出しなさい、と言っているのです」
<Page15>
"No, I'm more confused than before!//「いや、ますます分からない！
Is this what they do in the upper class? What the hell do you take normal folks for?!"
<Page16>
"Huh? I am telling you to take out your phone.//「？　ですから、携帯端末を出してください。Akiha uses the term "携帯端末"  here and Shiki does again a couple lines down. Do we want to put any emphasis on that?
You do have a mobile phone, don't you?"
"――――――#I see."
<Page17>
I take out the phone I've been keeping in the back pocket of my pants.
When I put it on the dining table, Hisui silently collects it and hands it to Akiha.
<Page18>
"I am confiscating this. This type of electronic device is prohibited in this house. They are unnecessary for healthy students.
If you want to use a phone, use the one provided in the lobby. If you want to do some research, please go to the library."
<Page19>
Ending the conversation, Akiha walks out of the dining room.
<Page20>
I'm standing here in shock for the umpteenth time today, and this is the biggest one yet.
It's not like I'm a sore loser, but I'm not even the type of person who uses a mobile phone that much.//負け惜しみではないが、俺はそこまで携帯を愛用するタイプではない。'even' emphasis mine to make it clear that Shiki is upset Akiha thinks he's a dirty phone-user
I only use it to check my email or to read the news while waiting. But I'm no different from other people in that my phone is a basic necessity in my life.
<Page21>
Once again, I shudder at the strictness of the Tohno family. I can't believe that in the age of the internet, there is still a family that bans mobile phones...!
