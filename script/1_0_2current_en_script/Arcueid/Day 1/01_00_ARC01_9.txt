I sit face to face with Akiha at the dinner table.
Hisui and Kohaku-san are focused on serving us.
A master and their servants do not sit at the same table.
...Naturally, it is an uncomfortable dinner for me, who is used to the company of the Arima family.
<Page2>
In addition, I have completely forgotten about table manners.
Humans are experts in optimization, relegating unused memories to a corner of the mind. In other words, there is no reason for me to remember table manners.
<Page3>
It is quite a tense, yet thrilling experience to see Akiha's eyebrows raise at every move I make.
...Honestly though, the thought of having to repeat this every day is really depressing.
<Page4>
Dinner ends without any conversation.
I was so busy trying to remember my table manners that I didn't have time for any conversation.
And Akiha seemed to be completely displeased, as expected.
<Page5>
Immediately afterward, Hisui and Kohaku-san finish cleaning up the dishes.
<Page6>
"―――It seems that a thorough re-education is necessary."
She says firmly.
The devil's words, merciless in content and chilling in tone, reverberate across the dining room.
<Page7>
"―――From whom, and what kind?"
"For you Nii-san, I want you to have an appropriate attitude."
I knew it...
So that's what she was thinking while eating, with her shapely eyebrows twitching...
<Page8>
"...What exactly do you mean by that?"
"The first thing to do is to improve your lifestyle. No going out at night, of course. The curfew is set at eight o'clock.
Whenever you go out for any reason, you have to ask permission from me, Kohaku or Hisui."
<Page9>
"Wha...?"
Eight o'clock curfew? At this age? And before that, I need someone's permission to go outside?
"Wait wait, that's..."
<Page10>
"I will be setting up a study schedule on days off.
According to the reports, your grades are just about average, are they not?
...#My goodness. You are only good at cutting corners efficiently as ever."
"No way. I always do my best."
<Page11>
"But while you live in this mansion, I will have you take things seriously, so be prepared for that.
I know you are a person who can do it if you put your mind to it, so even taking your health into account, you should be in the top three in your grade, should you not?"
<Page12>
It is a pain to be overestimated by your sister.
I'm also afraid that she has already investigated my grades.
<Page13>
"Let us wait until you are a little more settled before we do anything else.
So before that, ―――Nii-san, please take out that thing."
"What?"
What's that thing she's talking about?
<Page14>
"I am talking about that thing.
You have it, right? In your pants. That filthy thing is the symbol of youth.
I am telling you to not hide it and take it out."
<Page15>
"No, I don't understand at all!
Is this what they do in the upper class? What the hell do you take normal folks for?!"
<Page16>
"Huh? I am telling you to take out your phone.
You have a mobile phone, right?"
"――――――#I see."
<Page17>
I take out the phone I've been keeping in the back pocket of my pants.
When I put it on the dining table, Hisui silently collects it and hands it to Akiha.
<Page18>
"I am confiscating this. This type of electronic device is prohibited in this house. They are unnecessary for healthy students.
If you want to use a phone, use the one provided in the lobby. If you want to do some research, please go to the library."
<Page19>
Ending the conversation, Akiha walks out of the dining room.
<Page20>
I'm standing there in shock for the umpteenth time today, and the biggest one yet.
It's not that I'm a sore loser, but I'm not the type of person who uses a mobile phone that much.
I only use it to check for emails or to read the news while waiting. But I'm no different from other people in that my mobile phone is a basic necessity in my life.
<Page21>
Once again, I shudder at the strictness of the Tohno family. I can't believe that in the age of the internet, there is still a family that bans mobile phones...!
