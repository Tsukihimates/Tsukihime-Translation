"...Hah. No <lip|newlywed  > mark on the neck. No rejection of the holy water soaked into my shoes. For that matter, no change to my favorite funny face, either.
 Yep, heresy screening is over. Can you stand up now, Tohno Shiki-kun?"
<Page2>
 The foot on my chest pulls away.
 I get free and stand up, catching my breath.
 ...By the way, my body hurts like hell, but it's only minor internal bleeding.
<Page3>
"Here are your glasses. Be careful not to drop them, okay?"
"...I see. I dropped them by your side."
<Page4>
 I take my glasses from Noel and put them back on.
 ...Well.
 What's the situation here?
<Page5>
"Well, there are many dangers when a pretty boy goes out alone like this. I tried to scare you with some advice, but you almost ate it." //This feels wrong, check JP text
"Ufufu, no good at all," she smiles shyly.
".............."
 I'm completely stunned.
<Page6>
"Huh? Why no reaction?
 Didn't that vampire tell you about us?"
".............."
<Page7>
"You're not listening... Well, I guess they don't care about small fry like me. It's okay though, I don't want to be talked about anyway."
<Page8>
"Alright. I'll give you a quick lecture.
 To put it simply, I'm the righteous nee-san who protects the city? Something like that?
 Wouldn't it be cool to have a shadowy organization that protects human society from those damn vampires?"
<Page9>
 Noel giggles, making me wonder how serious she really is.
 Regardless of her explanation, I have an idea about the matter.
<Page10>
"...You're one of... the executors of the Church?"
"Yeah, an executor.
 You're an atheist, right? So you may not know it, but we, the Church, are willing to protect the good life of man in the name of the Lord. Even if it's in this land of degeneration." //Note: "End times" is refering to the Buddhist concept 末法 
<Page11>
"One day, a beautiful and seductive teacher suddenly transfers to the school, but in reality, she is a righteous exorcist sent by the church♡"
<Page12>
 Exorcist... I think she means exorcising demons, right?
 Aside from the fact that vampires aren't exactly demons, I don't think there are any lies in her words so far.
<Page13>
"...I understand. It's almost unbelievable coming out of nowhere, but I believe it. This is the second time, anyway.
 Thank you for saving me from a dangerous situation."
<Page14>
"Second time? ...Ah, that's what you mean.
 You know, this time is different. I didn't just stumble upon you by accident, I've been after you from the start."
<Page15>
"After me, since the start...?"
"Yeah. I've been following you since you left your house.
 My job is to eradicate vampires. If someone is following a vampire, it's only natural to keep an eye on them, right?"
<Page16>
"――――――"
 Her point is the natural conclusion. 
 But, the premise is wrong.
 I'm not Arcueid's follower, and she's a good vampire to begin with. Just like her, I'm hunting vampires to protect the city―――
<Page17>
"Then, that's..."
"Well, If that were true, I'd have killed the vampire first, but I'm dealing with that monster, aren't I? I can't fight on my own, and my master has been sent away by their boss.
 Unfortunately, I had no choice but to set my sights on the smaller ones.
<Page18>
"...Hmm. By small prey, do you mean me?"
<Page19>
"Yep. If that monster is a mad dog, then you're a plump shrimp. For vampire or one of us, you're sure to be delicious prey.♡
 ―――But, sooomething was wrong with him. //Too much?
 I've been watching you for the past few days, and I don't get the feeling that you're being forced to obey her, or that you're being bled dry. Hey, Shiki-kun? Why are you with that monster?"
<Page20>
"――――――"
 I furrow my brow and swallow my words.
 It wasn't that I feel pressured by Noel's question, but the very fact that I'm being asked such a question is annoying.
<Page21>
"Oh, shut up. Do you want to become one of the vampires?
 It's a bit cliché, but do you want eternal life?"
<Page22>
"――――――Wha?"
 Eternal life, she says, and my eyes light up.
 I hadn't thought of that... Although, I guess it's natural to think that way.
<Page23>
"...No, but..."
 That's not the case with Arcueid.
 In the first place, she doesn't suck blood. There's no way for her to recruit new followers or give them more power than normal humans.
<Page24>
"That's wrong? Then, why?"
"...It's obvious. We're just trying to help hunt down vampires for the city I live in."
<Page25>
 This time, I won't get defensive, I'll just confront her with my gaze.
 ...I'm not going to fight with this person.
 Even so, I appeal to her, saying that I don't want to be questioned about myself and Arcueid.
<Page26>
"..........If you'd been bitten, I'd have chopped you limb from limb and left you for dead with that garbage.
 Unfortunately, I can't touch a mere mortal. Yeah, I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
<Page27>
 Noel turns her back and walks away.
 I'm not sure I agree with that, but it seems to have lessened the hostility. ...No, maybe. She may have just lost interest with my current answer.
<Page28>
"Oh, but be warned. I said I had you in my sights from the start. I meant something deeper than that.
 The dead that have nested in this city have been taking root for more than a few years now.
 According to my master, they didn't arrive just yesterday like the true ancestors."
<Page29>
"Not all vampires come from the outside.
 In many cases, they are very close to us, and have been hiding for decades. <They|.> <are|.> <often|.> <in|.> <the|.> <homes|.> <of|.> <the|.> <most|.> <powerful|.> <people|.> <in|.> <the|.> <city|.>."
<Page30>
"Understand? You said you were going to protect your city.
 I don't mean to be vague, but you should really be protecting yourself."
"―――What do you mean?"
<Page31>
"It's obvious, no?
 That undead was after you. Not the true ancestor who goes around killing vampires, but you, a mere human."
"――――――"
"Fufu. I'll see you again if you're still alive, <T|.><o|.><h|.><n|.><o|.> Shiki-kun."
<Page32>
 With that, the woman in the nun's uniform walks away.
 As she leaves, she casts her gaze over the lamppost and said
"Okay, let's jump home in style. Oh, but I can't.
 It's impossible to jump that high without a running start, and if you could, you wouldn't be human―"
 With a hint of anger in her voice, she walks down the slope with a large spear.
<Page33>
"...Despite her appearance, she's a really amazing person..."
 I mutter, totally exhausted.
 As if that isn't enough, I lose the strength in my knees and lean against the wall with a thump.
<Page34>
"But... I'm the one who was targeted...?"
 As long as I'm working with Arcueid, I will eventually be in danger of that.
 Yet, that's not it.
 I'm not sure why, but I feel like that's not the actual reason...
<Page35>
"Tch―――――"
 As I am released from my nervousness, the dizziness returns.
 Leaning against the wall, I start walking towards the main gate.
<Page36>
 ...My chest hurts.
 While I'm still conscious, I'll manage to get back to my room before my legs can't support me anymore.
 ...I can think about the hard stuff afterwards.
<Page37>
 ...But the main gate is further away than I expected.
 My headache is fading,
 And I feel disgust at my relaxing body.
 I rest my back against the wall and stare at myself as I drift off to sleep―――
