I'm curious about Arihiko's story, but in the end, it's just an abandoned building that's two stations away.
It probably has nothing to do with the vampire that's lurking in Souya.
It's not like I have the stamina to go there anyway, so I'll just simply return to the mansion and prepare for the night ahead.
