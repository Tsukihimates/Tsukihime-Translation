After climbing up the hill, I reach the main gate of the mansion.
It's around two in the morning.
I'm getting sleepy.
<Page2>
"...I wonder if she'll be okay."
I was concerned about Arcueid's condition when we parted.
I don't think the issue was something like an injury or exhaustion, but―――
<Page3>
"Huh?"
What's that?
Halfway between two streetlights. In the dark where no light reaches, something is standing―――
<Page4>
――――――Thump.
At first, there is only fear.
It is a sense of impossibility that stops the heart.
 Unfortunately, my <guts|heart  > already have a tolerance for such things.
As my heartbeat quietly resumes, I slip a knife into my right hand. 
<Page5>
――――――Thump.
I feel like the speed of the blood flowing in my body has doubled. It might be an illusion.
That thing is clearly human.
It just doesn't look right. The outline is alien.
<Page6>
It's getting closer and closer.
Click, clack, click.
I can hear the sound of dry footsteps.
There, a single bare eyeball stares at me, bloodshot.
<Page7>
――――Thu, mp.
I release the knife's blade.
I place my hand on the rim of my glasses.
 A chill crawls up my spine like a <hundred feet.|centipede          >
The shadow will enter lethal distance with one more step.
 Suddenly―――The streetlights cut out with a bang.
<Page8>
 The moon is also hidden in the clouds.
The world suddenly goes dark.
Thump.
As if to announce my death, my heart leaps.
A steel blade flashes toward the line on my upper left arm.
It's going to take a while for my <consiousness|reason      > to catch up.
<Page9>
Before the blade that cuts through the dark is fully extended, I flick its tip up from below, barely deflecting.
"―――Heh."
The shadow's mouth twists. I recognize it as a laugh.
But, first―――
I'll intercept their weapon to the fullest degree...!
<Page10>
"Tch...!"
I'm surprised. Yet, my thoughts are calm. Not even a second has passed since the moment I saw this figure. My thoughts stop. Frozen in time. Even the fact that I'm being attacked is not worthy of surprise now.
<Page11>
The two weapons spark in the darkness.
The unnatural darkness even hides their forms from each other.
And yet, in the midst of it all,
The connection of life shines clearly.
<Page12>
As the knife fires out, I predict it and counter.
It's strange.
In this pitch darkness, my body accurately blocks the deadly weapon that strikes without pause.
<Page13>
Are the opponent's actions that easy to read?
Think about it. It's totally wrong.
My arm is simply following the lines and points that I can see with my naked eye.
That's all I can see, so I'm just swinging my blade at it as fast as I can.
<Page14>
My head. //This bit is intentionally repetitive, but it still reads a little weird. 
My head hurts.
My thoughts overheat.
My chest aches.
My head hurts. The old wound in my chest is burning.
My eyes feel like they're about to spill out of their sockets.
<Page15>
But I remember.
I'm pretty sure this happened to me a long time ago.
Yeah, that's right.
A child's corpse, covered in blood.
Akiha's crying face, covered in blood.
My hands, covered in blood―――
<Page16>
 The impact of <metal|knife  > striking <metal|knife  >.
An instinct that transcends reason deflects the blade.
It's dangerous. I had just lost consciousness for a moment.
But I won't screw up again.
Because I know where I'm being targeted. As long as I know, my instincts will cut through it before my reason catches up.
<Page17>
The reason I know is simple.
They're aiming for the "lines" on my body.
So, I don't need to read where he's aiming.
In this stance, all I need to do is find the best "line" to strike and stop them.
<Page18>
As I become aware of that fact as a strategy, I finally speak.
"You... can see them?"
I understand that this "something" is seeing the same thing as me.
<Page19>
"―――Heh."
The shadow laughs in the darkness.
Its bloodshot eyes sneer, "So you finally noticed."
<Page20>
"―――, Ha."
My heart pumps blood faster than ever.
I feel an inexplicable elation/fear, and my mouth hangs open.
I see. So we're evenly matched. If I get cut, I'll die instantly too.
<Page21>
"―――Ha, ha."
I don't care. What does it matter now? I'll die no matter where they cut me. If I got cold feet so easily, I would be dead right now. Think of that ice wave. Vlov was incredible. This person is nothing compared to that vampire. That's right. Even if they're Arcueid's target.
In this situation, I'm definitely stronger than them―――!
<Page22>
Attacking. //Feel free to use a better word for "攻めている" if you can think of one!
Attacking.
I am the one attacking.
This person is defending with everything they have. In other words. It's not that I'm stopping them, but that they're stopping me.
<Page23>
―――I can win.
I don't know what they are, but I'm sure.
I'm the one who's pressuring them now.
I have goosebumps. I'm elated by the overwhelming advantage.
I can win. I'm stronger than them.
It's because I'm stronger than them.
If they try to kill me, I'll just kill them back.
<Page24>
I flick the enemy's blade and send it flying.
I take a step forward, thrusting my dagger like a fang to cut the "line" in their defenseless chest.
Oh, but it's <natural|strange   >.
As I wield my weapon in this situation, why is there no hesitation in my hands―――?
<Page25>
"Eh―――?"
As the streetlights light up again, my burning thoughts switch to something more normal.
<Page26>
There is no one in front of me.
The shadow that was trying to kill me just now,
has been stabbed in the by a long, thin object and sent flying to the mansion fence.
<Page27>
―――I don't understand what's happening at all.
The figure that attacked me... that man... was pierced through the torso by what looked like a pipe that had flown from the side.
<Page28>
The impact must have sent him flying to the wall.
If he was human, it would have been a fatal wound.
But no matter how you look at it, that man couldn't have been human.
<Page29>
"―――Nuisance."
A hoarse voice.
The man skewered in the stomach stares into the void, gasping.
I keep my distance and follow his gaze.
There,
<Page30>
A familiar figure was standing on a streetlight.
<Page31>
"Noel... sensei?"
She's dressed like a foreign priest.
Holding a thin sword in her right hand,
And an absurdly huge spear in her left.
<Page32>
...I know that figure.
No, a part of my brain remembers seeing it before.
I am aware of the fact, even if I was not conscious of it, that that sword saved Tohno Shiki from the ice mass during the battle with Vlov.
<Page33>
"――――――"
Our eyes meet.
The woman standing on top of the streetlamp smiles at me, and in the next moment,
fires the thin sword in her hand at the black shadow.
<Page34>
"Behold, the church." //Took a little liberty with this one, tone it down if you like.
The light rose with the words.
<Page35>
The wind is cleaved with a woosh.
She readies her huge spear,
and leaps from the top of the streetlamp at the man.
<Page36>
"AAAAAAAAAaAAA!" //Lowercase A is intentional, matching the JP text.
The man who was cut down screams.
The shadowy thing that had been clinging to him is knocked away by Noel's great spear.
Like the deformed dead in the parking lot, the figure, shadow and all, melts away.
<Page37>
Even in the midst of it all, the man is staring at me.
Bloodshot eyes with nothing but murderous intent.
Black eyes like a murder weapon, as if he was cursing only Tohno Shiki.
<Page38>
"―――――"
There was nothing to do but be stunned.
The man disappears along with the shadow that was torn off.
...Leaving no trace at all, he vanishes from this world.
<Page39>
The voices of insects and the wind. The sounds of a normal night returned.
Even though there had been such a horrible scream, the surrounding area was submerged in the darkness of the night as if nothing had happened.
<Page40>
...And there's a distinctly alien person standing in front of me.
<Page41>
"Good evening. I've heard that it's safe at night in this country, but it's so dangerous around here. I was just taking a stroll when I saw a vampire-like creature attacking my cute little student.
Or is it―――that your surroundings are special, Tohno Shiki-kun?"
<Page42>
A woman in a nun's uniform looks back at me.
She smiles at me, making no attempt to hide her overflowing hatred, her clear intent to kill.
...There's no doubt about it.
This is the person assigned to my school, the person named Noel.
<Page43>
"Noel-sensei... is that okay?"
"Fufu. I guess so. Sensei doesn't sound so bad, but this is outside school, right? It's easier for both of us if you don't think of me as your teacher."
<Page44>
Clunk, a hard sound echoes.
Noel steps forward.
With a smile on her face and that vicious spear in her hand, she approaches me.
I―――
C:>...face her as an enemy.
C:>...brace myself with caution.
