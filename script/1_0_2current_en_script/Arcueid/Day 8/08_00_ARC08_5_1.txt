...... Let's be honest.
No matter how much I try to fool them, I can't hide it from Hisui and Kohaku-san who are in charge of the mansion,
Then I'll at least let them know that I'll be out for the night.
<Page2>
"...... Aahh. Actually, I'm going to be out for the next few nights.
But I swear, I'm not taking part in anything bad. I understand Akiha may resent me for it, but I can't let that stop me."
<Page3>
...... That's right.
If there's an unidentified vampire, thats slaughtered numerous people, and Arcueid is the only one who can stop them.
Then as someone who lives in this city, ignorance isn't an option.
<Page4>
"I know this is going to trouble you Hisui, but it'd be nice if you could overlook this for a while. I'll be back by midnight, so please leave the front door unlocked for me."
<Page5>
"You can't tell us why, can you?"
"...That's right. I'm sorry, Hisui. I'm just being sloppy and I'd rather you not ask anything right now."
<Page6>
"......No. Shiki-sama, you are my master.
No servant would disparage their master as a sloppy person."
<Page7>
With no expression on her face, Hisui spoke plainly.
Then the conversation ceased.
I bow my head to Hisui and walk up the stairs to the lobby.
<Page8>
"Please wait.#"
.......
From behind me, Hisui stops me with the most well-mannered voice I've ever heard.
<Page9>
"...... I'm sorry to bother you, but..."
Hisui cut off her words once, then clasped her hands together and looks at me.
<Page10>
"As long as you are willing Shiki-sama, I can conceal the fact that you're going out at night from Akiha-sama."
"Does that mean you're going to get our stories straight... Is that what you mean?"
<Page11>
"Yes. It's quite rare for Akiha-sama to leave her room after dinner. My sister and I make the rounds before bedtime, so if we fail to report it, no one will know what's going on in Shiki-sama's room."
<Page12>
"That's great. No, that's helpful, but is that...... okay?
Akiha is the employer of both of you."
"I believe I've told you that you are my master Shiki-sama."
<Page13>
.......I'm not sure myself.
I had told her to stop calling me "sama", but now I'm furiously thanking her.
Hisui, in her own way, listened to my poor excuse and stated she would help me.
<Page14>
"Thank you, Hisui. That would be a great help."
"Then please use this card key tonight.
Akiha-sama told me to change the password of the main gate of the mansion.
If you use this key card, you'd be able to unlock the main gate even in the middle of the night."
<Page15>
"Wow, that's Akiha for you, she's quick to react......"
That was close...... If I had gone out without knowing this, I might have ended up spending the night in front of the main gate on my way back.
<Page16>
"That is all I have to say.
I will not stop you from going out at night, but please be careful and do not get hurt."
With that, Hisui bows and leaves.
<Page17>
"――――― I did it."
A helping hand unexpectedly came to the rescue.
I'll be able to get out of the mansion without worrying about Akiha in the future.
<Page18>
After dinner alone, I went back to my room.
It was almost ten o'clock in the evening.
"Okay... let's go."
I tuck the knife into my pocket and leave the room, making as little noise as possible.
