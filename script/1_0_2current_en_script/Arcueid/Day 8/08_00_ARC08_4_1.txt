"......Kushigata Hospital......"
Not that I've been influenced by Arcueid, but it's not like it would be a waste of time investigating suspicious places during the day.
It's two stations away from here, I'm sure it's unrelated, but I still have some time before nightfall, so I'll check there anyway.

From the terminal at Kushigata Station, it takes 20 minutes by bus.
It takes another 20 minutes to walk from the nearest bus stop.
In the middle of the factory district, away from the residential area, the former hospital was dead silent.

Even from the main gate, you can see how large the inside is.# It must've been a very big hospital before it was closed down.

The peeled off asphalt is being eroded by the grass.

The sky looked vast and wide here.
There weren't any tall buildings around, so the blue sky fills my vision.

I cut the barbed wire with a knife and go into the premises for a bit, but there's nothing unusual here.
......I even took off my glasses of my own volition, but I didn't see any disturbance in the lines like those of the "dead".
This place seems to be just an abandoned building that's been forgotten by everyone.

It was a waste of time, but I guess that's what research is all about. I return to the main gate to check the time for the next bus.
There is a return bus in ten minutes. If I ran, I could make it just in time.
I shrug my shoulders and decide to run for the bus stop.
