Hisui sends me off and I left the Tohno residence. 
......I'm worried about Akiha, who left the room in a rage, but as long as the cause of the rage is Arcueid, we'll end up going around in circles.
I'm sorry for Akiha, but I have to stay like this until the case is over.

"......But I wonder. I hadn't really thought about it......."
I wonder if it's possible just to be honest and tell the whole truth about what I experienced. ......?
Even if people don't believe me, if it leads to the safety of the city, I should letting people know about vampires right now.
<Page3>
"......That' s right.
For example, spreading it as gossip on the internet. ......"
<Page4>
As I walked, I took out my mobile phone.
It doesn't matter if it's credible or not, I just have to post what I know now on the bulletin board.
<Page5>
It is up to the individuals to decide how they want to take it.
It is counterproductive to tell people to believe, but if you just post the information, it may be spread as an urban legend with a warning.
<Page6>
"Uh, hello? Hey, you there."
"?"
The call stopped me in my tracks.
<Page7>
I turned around.
I saw an unfamiliar man in a suit.
<Page8>
"......you mean me?"
"Yeah, you. I mean, who else would be walking down the street like this?"
<Page9>
That's true.
This is the national highway in front of the Tohno residence, and only cars pass by.
The only people traveling on foot might be me and the servants of the Tohno mansion.
<Page10>
"So... You just came out of this house, didn't you? Are you the son of one of the servants who works inside?
If so, then it's lucky day, very lucky day. Not for you, but for me. Don't you want some pocket money? I'd like to know more about the Tohno family."
"..............."
<Page11>
I somehow kept my distance.
It was not because I was annoyed by the man's flippant tone.
Rather, it was too serious and frightening.
In the midst of all the nonsense, I felt the seriousness of the man's attention to make sure I didn't miss a single thing about his attitude.......
<Page12>
"Do you think I'm an onlooker?
Well, I am an onlooker, but you ll get your money's worth.
What I want to know is about the story of the eldest son who recently came back to the house. I don't have any photo materials because he just came back. I want to know what he looks like, what his favorite food is, what type of girl he likes, and frankly, what he's weak against.―――#What the hell?"
<Page13>
A frivolous man jumps up and down, holding his crotch.
"Take a closer look you brainless idiot, and that's the TOHNO SHIKI, no matter how you look at it."
<Page14>
A child......?
A boy about twelve years old, hidden behind the man, apparently kicked that man in the groin from behind.
<Page15>
"Wait, are you serious?
He doesn't smell bougie at all?!"
"What the hell would that smell like? Money doesn't smell like that. Or is it the smell of dirt? Are you saying that rich people in Germany are covered in dirt? That's a pretty lame thing to say, isn't it?"
<Page16>
"No, no, no, only the rich, only some of the rich! You know, like loan sharks who spend half their day counting their money?"
"Is that my old man you're talking about? How dare you criticize your boss, Andou?"
<Page17>
......What the hell is this situation......?
Should I call the police?
<Page18>
"Oh, you there, don't call 110 without saying a word! Why do young people nowadays do so many dry and useless things? #Look, here, here."
"What?"
<Page19>
I looked away from my mobile device as I typed in 1-1.
The man was holding up a black notebook.
It was the first time I'd ever seen one in person, but it was, without a doubt, a police badge.
<Page20>
"That's a police badge..... Are you a detective by any chance?"
<Page21>
"That's right. I'm not a suspicious person. I'm a detective. I'm Yuugo Andou of the Metropolitan Police Department's Investigation Division 1.
And yet, I have been turned away from the door since yesterday.
I just wanted to talk to you for a while, but they told me to make an appointment. So I had no choice but to go on a stakeout on the national highway."
<Page22>
".................."
There aren't many detectives as suspicious as this one.
......But.
I'm not sure if that badge is real or not, but I'm curious as to why they were staking out the front of my house.
I'm not in the mood...
C:>but I'll ask him what they want.
C:>So I'll ignore them.
