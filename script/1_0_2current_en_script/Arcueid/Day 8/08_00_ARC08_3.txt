My daily life proceeds without a hitch.
Fourth period, Modern Society.
The teacher standing on the podium reads out a very common, unremarkable textbook.
While listening to this, I take advantage of my seat by the window and look at my reflection in the window glass objectively.
<Page2>
"..................
......I can't seem to get into it.
It's not that I'm bored in class, it's just that I can't seem to get my head around this situation.
<Page3>
A fire breaks out in front of the station, killing many people.
A city that has been invaded by vampires.
I know these things, and yet I think about myself as I sit here taking classes without a care in the world.
<Page4>
Needless to say, my behavior is abnormal.
If I were in this situation, I would either lock myself in my house or run away.
<Page5>
And yet, here I am, following the same <life|cycle> as before.
Whether there are vampires or not, it's just an anomaly, not something to be dealt with to the point of abandoning your daily life.
<Page6>
"...... but, well, it's a real story."
I simply can't neglect school as a student.
<Page7>
It reminded me of a conversation I had with the man I met at the mansion, Saiki Gotou.
In that man's way, study is an investment in the future.
Abandoning the building up of the future for the sake of a little safety in the present is not the way to go.
<Page8>
In the first place, I'm living on the Tohno family's money. If I'm going to live in that house, I have to fulfill my minimum obligations as a student. This is not a matter of duty but of obligation, a matter of decency.
<Page9>
Am I being stubborn or subservient?
Or am I just insensitive?
My Sensei told me, "Be the person you think is right."
As long as I can rely on those words, I am still going to cherish this everyday life.
<Page10>
I squint my eyes at the sunlight streaming through the window.
My fourth class will be over in twenty minutes.
Today's classes will last until the fifth lesson.
<Page11>
I think about working with Alcade again when school is over and night falls.
My face reflected in the window pane was smiling, my mouth turned up in a happy smile.
<Page12>
"――――"
I tighten my mouth.
It's not fun to roam around the city at night with Arcueid, and I don't know what I'm smiling about.
<Page13>
"......good grief......"
It's no wonder I'm not concentrating on my classes.
Afterall, I can see a vision of her walking gracefully in the schoolyard overlooking the glass.
<Page14>
―――Hey, what the hell is going on!!!?
<Page15>
I leaned forward a bit so as not to disrupt the class, or rather, so as not to be noticed by everyone in the classroom.
Please, I must be looking at something wrong......!
<Page16>
Alright, it's not an illusion.
It's not some fluffy thing. It's real no matter how you try to fool yourself.
Maybe it's always clear in my mind, that vampire!
<Page17>
What to do. What's going to happen? What will happen to Tohno Shiki's school life if I leave her like this?
<Page18>
"................"
No, calm down, it's still okay, no worries.
The other students haven't noticed, and there's no commotion coming from the classroom next door. Fortunately, she seems to be in a position where she can only be seen from this classroom at the moment.
<Page19>
"A genuine, rootless Sadamitsu the Destroyer......!"
I hold my head in my hands and curse in my heart.
But that doesn't solve anything.
<Page20>
Twenty minutes left until lunchtime.
I can't predict what that wild vampire will do if I leave her alone.
<Page21>
I'll――
C:>Do my best to intercept.
C:>Do my best to concentrate on class.
C:>Ignore her all costs.
