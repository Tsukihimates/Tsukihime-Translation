―――In the middle of a residential area.
An ordinary, unassuming four floor apartment building.
<Page2>
There are about four rooms per floor, and most of them are lit up. The inhabitants are not asleep yet, and are spending their time in their own ways.
Whether this is legitimate or not is unknown to those watching from the outside.
<Page3>
"――――――、Tch――――――!"
I look at the lines.
The pressure in my brain makes me want to vomit.
<Page4>
......This place is strange.
The lines running through the building are very ordinary, but there is something odd and shivery about it.
<Page5>
Maybe it was the whiteness of the lights leaking from the room.
The woman who had just returned to the apartment had many lines of death swirling around her body.
<Page6>
"―――Yeah. I knew it."
Alcade heads for the slope leading to the underground garage rather than the entrance of the apartment building.
The entrance to the underground garage was locked.
<Page7>
"It's just an ordinary apartment. You sure this is the place, Arcueid?"
<Page8>
"Yeah. These shutters are surrounded by a barrier to keep people out and to eliminate odors.
Is that a camera? It's catching my image, but the dead people inside don't have time to escape. They would have escaped if I had come alone in the daytime, though."
<Page9>
Arcueid bends down and puts her hand on the edge of the shutter.
I thought she was going to pull it up at once, but...
<Page10>
"Shiki. Can you cut this shutter?"
"Yes, of course but is it...... good?"
"Yes. You are more qualified than me. If I force it open, the alarm will go off."
<Page11>
......So be it.
Arcueid is calm when the time comes to execute the task.
<Page12>
"Shiki, this is the entrance to the garage.
If this is a nest, there should be nearly ten undead inside.
If there's only one, you're stronger, but if there are more than two, you're at a disadvantage."
<Page13>
"Apart from that, I'm fine......  Okay, I'm cutting it."
I cut the "line" of the shutters.
The iron door falls to the concrete floor with a clatter.
Through the gap in the shutter, I peer into the blackness.
<Page14>
"What's that smell......!?"
A strange odor hit my nose.
The garage was filled with the smell of smoldering flesh and thick blood.
<Page15>
There was a bunch of "lines" swirling around inside.
They must have noticed us, their guests, when we cut down the shutters.
<Page16>
There were twenty-two of them. If there are this many dead, this must be the 'parent's stronghold'......!
<Page17>
"Alcade, there are more of them than we expected......!
This is where they're staying, right? Then I guess I'll have to――"
<Page18>
"What? This is not a stronghold, it's just a cafeteria.
Don't worry, an immortal who has just woken up is like a worm. Shiki, wait there, I'll be back in a minute!"
<Page19>
"―――――― Really?"
A series of unexpected scenes made it difficult for my consciousness to <respond|channel> in time.
After being shown a grave filled with sludge.
It was such a poor match looking at the start of a magnificent figure skating session.
<Page20>
The myriad of dead awakes to attack their visitor.
Tearing occurs with a single swing of the arm.
Fangs swarms. Dead flesh flies around. In the rain of blood, a white shadow dances without getting a single bit wet.
<Page21>
Even though I've seen it many times already, it always makes me hold my breath.
...That's right.
There was no way those zombies were going to fight with her.
<Page22>
Performance is different. Perspectives are different. Dimensions of existence are different.
Beating your opponent hands down, this is what it means to be a warrior.
For Arcueid, blood-sucking vampires are probably no different from us humans.
<Page23>
"............"
I get a headache. It's the price of having bare eyes, but I still can't wear glasses.
<Page24>
Even though Arcueid alone is enough, there are still more than ten corpses left.
At that rate, she'll be able to wipe them out in less than a minute, but until Arcueid's fight is over, I have to――
<Page25>
"......?"
Something's wrong.
Arcueid's movements are slowing down.
<Page26>
She's unharmed.
She didn't even let the undead near her in the first place.
And yet...
And yet, each time she tore the undead apart, one by one, her face seemed to twist in pain.
<Page27>
―――Tyranny in the air.
Before I knew it, there was only one undead left.
There was no need for excessive violence anymore. She could end it with a single swing of her arm.
And yet...
The white shadow, perhaps seeing this as opportunity, did not conserve its strength and crushed the human-shaped object.
<Page28>
It was over.
Arcueid drops his shoulders in the center of the carnage and adjusts her erratic breathing. 
......That moron. I don't know what kind of change of heart she had, but she used too much power unnecessarily.
She would have been able to handle the situation much more lightly, with only about a tenth of the rage she has now.
<Page29>
"Arcueid."
I call out from the entrance of the garage.
<Page30>
"Oh, how's it going? Did you see me, Shiki?
It's the end of the night, and I was in front of you, so I went harder than usual."
<Page31>
"You know...... I've never heard such a disturbing 'I am so worked up'......."
I sigh.
<Page32>
...... Give me a break please.
The reason why you went extra rampant than usual is because you simply wanted to show off to me, and I seriously don't know how to react.
<Page33>
"............... Well.
It's true that I was a little bit impressed, but..."
The upbeat mood is cut short.
Sudden stop of thought. Blankness of consciousness.
I can't believe my eyes, but there is something abnormal there.
<Page34>
How long had it been there?
No, how long had I overlooked it?
The black panther that appeared in the alleyway.
Burning corpses.
The dead mimicking humans.
I've seen many anomalies in the past few days. I've experienced a lot of things I've never experienced before.
<Page35>
But they are all alterations from reality.
They are modifications of things that are real. It's an extension of what we've always known.
That was different.
The air is different. The type is different, the process of creation is different.
It was a 'different kind' that is not supposed to exist in our city or in Arcueid's world.
<Page36>
It was humanoid.
It smelled like the dead.
But it abandoned its humanity, gave up being a homo sapiens.
I can't detect the breath of life. I can't see its ability to respond to light.
My instincts tell me that it's just a predator.
<Page37>
I know something similar to this, even though I've never seen it before.
―――It's a spider.
<Page38>
"――――――"
My thoughts are still halted.
I can't remember how to use my throat.
Bzzzzzz, the flesh of his abdomen unfolded like a receding wave.
<Page39>
It seems that the swollen flesh was not from abdominal fat, but form of hardened "arms".
It's a weird multi-armed thing that flexes like a mollusk.
The tip of the arm is...
<Page40>
"Arcueid!"
I shouted.
Sensing the abnormality, Arcueid turns around.
<Page41>
The waving tentacle extended and retracted like a whip, and swept across Arcueid's neck.
<Page42>
It took a moment, but it was too late to catch Arcueid off guard.
Arcueid's claws had torn through the dead like they were scraps of paper.
It was only natural that the vile whip of flesh would be used again soon.
<Page43>
"Kyaa...!?"
But the whip of flesh was not cut off by the vacuum claws.
Although it was hit hard, the momentum did not slow down, and it bit into the back of the white figure as if it was going around her.
<Page44>
"――――――"
There was a click, the sound of a trigger dropping in the back of my skull.
A deformed dead man in hiding. ―――Sometimes it happens.
The hardness of the concealed hull. ―――Sometimes it happens.
The ugliness of the dead is different from that of the dead. Sometimes it happens that way too.
On top of that.
Second and third whip of flesh unleashed, hoping to kill Arcueid.
―――Well, that is not going to happen.
<Page45>
Stupid.
Idiot.
If she hadn't done what she did, if she hadn't wasted her energy, she wouldn't have a problem with that monster. I can't believe it. She's got a new wound. She's trapped against the wall confused. She's breathing hard. Her steps are sluggish. She's taking a blow that even I can survive, and she's taking it hard.
<Page46>
"Tch..."
I am sincerely glad that I am not wearing my glasses.
I would have smashed them in anger.
The deformed dead jumped up as if in a rush.
A lowly smile stretches across its cheek as it looks at its prey, which it would never normally reach.
<Page47>
"―――Tch."
Don't mess with me. Don't mess with me. Don't mess with me. That's mine. It's my responsibility. It's my role. She's the one who told me she forgave me, this inhuman being, even though I killed her, even though she fell to the ground because I killed her, even though she was killed just for pleasure. And then...
"―――I'll kill you, you son of a bitch―――!"
Do not lick her with your <imperfect|ugly> meat......!
<Page48>
Disconnection. A simple, untwisted, animalistic movement.
Was I running?
Is he approaching?
It doesn't matter. There is no stagnation in my feet.
<Page49>
The second arm was brought out. It's a small fist that looks like a dot from the opponent's point of view, different from the large fist he used earlier. It's a jab as in boxing. The smallest action, the fastest muscle movement. The speed of light, force too fast for human eyesight to follow and for the body to react.
No problem at all. If a human being can't dodge, then it's just a matter of letting it break in front of you.
<Page50>
Follow fledgling back. A red-crazed deadly disconnection.
Needless to say, I cut an efficient line. 
The left leg of the thing was on the verge of 'death', which I was most wary of.
The only protection left is the bite, but I already know it's coming.
A little to the right above the Dantian, I pierce the ringing 'dot'.
<Page51>
I could not hear the screams of the dying.
The oddly shaped creature stopped all movement and died, like a mechanical doll whose batteries had been drained.
<Page52>
"―――――#Aa"
After finishing the job, I finally started to breathe again.
<Page53>
Pieces of rotting flesh scattered around me.
The dead I had killed was already reduced to ashes.
The dead that Arcueid killed have not changed in any way, so I guess that particular variant was special.
<Page54>
"O――oh."
However, I killed it.
Even if it was a different form, I did not hesitate and stopped it from breathing.
"Ha-ah."
My head can't think properly.
That was pure assault.
It was just a outburst that did not include any part of the lessons that the Sensei had taught me, and left me to my feelings. It was the act of a murderer that I had always been scared of, something I should never do.
<Page55>
"Ha-ha-ha-ha."
Regret. Self-condemnation. Hatred. Disappointment. These emotions will surely fall on me when I calm down.
<Page56>
......But it's okay. It's fine.
It's much better than Alquaid getting hurt.
For the first time in my life.
Without hesitation, I used this power for the sake of a woman, while keeping my reason intact.
<Page57>
"........., ......, .........."
Looking behind me, Arcueid's both shoulders were shaking and her breathing was erratic.
<Page58>
"Are you okay, Arcueid......!"
I ran over to Arcueid.
She was holding her chest to endure the pain, huffing and puffing, suffering like a creature that only knows how how to breathe.
<Page59>
"Idiot, you let your guard down! You're too stupid to act like that!
Are you okay? Did you open the wound in your body......?"
"........., ........."
The back of the Arcueid shakes with a clatter.
<Page60>
...... It's terrible. The sweat on the body is not normal.
I wonder if she has been injured in the chest, and bent down to look at Arcueid's face, and...
<Page61>
"Pfft...pfft...hahahaha! Ha-ha-ha!"
"―――Hey."
<Page62>
"Oh my god, Shiki, you're such an animal!
I think that's a little too much!"
"........................"
<Page63>
This is horrible.
Arcueid wasn't bending over because the wound hurt.
She was holding her stomach to keep from laughing.
<Page64>
"Are you crying falsely, or have you been poisoned by human society too much!?
You're fine, I was stupid to worry! You're so sturdy, there's no way you'd be injured by something like that!"
<Page65>
"Oh, that's so harsh. The pain was real.
If I had been pushed a little harder, that thing would have cut my stomach open again!"
"Ugh. ......"
It's an unfair thing to say.
No matter what I say, it will be my responsibility, so I will have to shut up entirely.
<Page66>
"......Huh. Yes, yes, I understand. I'm sorry about that.
I'm glad you're okay, despite that stupid laugh you just gave me."
<Page67>
Phh, I cut her off in a sarcastic tone.
.......
But again, she has a mysterious grimace on her face.
<Page68>
What is it?" Is there something more?"
"Yes. And I'm not faking crying. I'm really happy.
Because you're so reliable."
"――――――"
My cheeks are burning. I turned my face away as best I could from the surprise.
<Page69>
"What? What's the matter, Shiki?"
"No, nothing. I am a little overheated, you see."
It was a deception without any specifics about what it was.
<Page70>
Anyway, I averted my gaze from Arcueid.
I covered my face with my hands to hide the redness in my cheeks, but the act itself made me even more red.
<Page71>
"――――――."
What's with the face? I wonder if she's going to admire my killing skills in this time, place and occasion. She's no less than a demoness afterall. Why I'm crazy for being happy about that? Let's calm down. I must calm down and get over this unexpected feeling.
<Page72>
"............Okay, I'm calm.
So, what should we do now? You know, even if this isn't the enemy's base, maybe we should go in and look for clues ......?"
<Page73>
"Well, maybe we can check it out before people get here.
There won't be any clues about the coffin, but perhaps the location of the other cafeteria――"
".................."
<Page74>
It was no use at all.
I couldn't stop the palpitations in my chest. My face was burning.
My head is foggy, and Arcueid's voice is breezing past me.
...But I think it can't be helped.
When someone smiles like that and says something like that, anyone would fall in love with them.
The reason why my head hurts so much and why my limbs are so heavy is all because of Arcueid...
<Page75>
"...... Shiki? Hey, are you okay?
"It's a fever.......
That dead guy was so hard to see!"
<Page76>
"...No, it wasn't...but...
...aren't, you, kinda, close...?"
My head is not working properly.
I'm conscious, but my thoughts are dull, and my body senses are very disconnected......
<Page77>
"Let's stop investigating and take a break.
They won't leave any clues anyway, and it's enough that we were able to destroy the dining area today. If they lost this many underlings, they won't be able to act for a while, and they'll have to come out on their own."
<Page78>
The grip on my arm was pulled.
I nodded vaguely at Arcueid's words and left the underground garage covered in dead flesh.
