I return to the mansion.
The sun hasn't set yet and Akiha hasn't returned.
<Page2>
"Akiha, I bet you're still angry about this morning......"
It was only natural for Akiha to be angry at my behavior.
<Page3>
I haven't done anything good since I got back.
I wish I could tell the truth about the situation, but I don't think anyone would believe a vampire story.
For the time being, I'm going to play the role of a sloppy older brother, one you're meant to hate.

"Welcome home, Shiki-sama."
"I'm back, Hisui. Thank you for welcoming me.
...... uhm, Akiha hasn't come home yet?"
<Page5>
"Yes. I have been told that tonight she'll be returning home late, so I have been ordered to inform you that you'll be having dinner on your own."
<Page6>
...... I see.
I was hoping to at least talk to her about whatever subjects she had, but that's a shame.
I think I'll just go to my room and relax for the rest of the day.
<Page7>
"...Shiki-sama."
"Hmm? What is it, Hisui?"
Hisui glanced around the lobby, and then called out to me again.
<Page8>
"I'm sorry to ask this, but will you be going out again tonight, Shiki-sama?"
<Page9>
Hisui looks straight at me.
I don't mind if she knows that I'm trying to slip out.......
This is because Hisui knows that I haven't been in my room at night.
It's only natural to think that I might try to slip out again.
<Page10>
But the issue is the purpose of this question.
As a servant, she's obligated to know what time I will be back...... but honestly answering Hisui means that Akiha will know too.
<Page11>
......This isn't a question that can be casually answered.
Here I will―――
C:>...speak honestly.
C:>...lie and deceive.
