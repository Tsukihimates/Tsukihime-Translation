A block of ice flies through the air.
The ice splits into spears that go straight for my head.
―――Should I avoid them or take them head-on?
Do I continue to hide it or do I cast away my only weapon?
I subconsciously make a decision.
<Page2>
"―――!"
A headache strains my brain.
I focus my eyes on the deadly weapon from within my completely immersed state.
If those lines represent the 'death of existence',
then I will kill the spear's form, its inertia and the sub-zero bonds right before my eyes...!
<Page3>
Death grazes my temple.
I match my knife to the soaring icicles. A man is but a wild beast. We were equipped with such kinetic vision and reflexes a long time ago.
<Page4>
If my body can still move adequately, then a weapon like this is no different than a giant pebble.
However―――
<Page5>
However, this brings an end to my frontal 'surprise attack'.
The man's eyes speak to me.
They tell me that he saw it.
They tell me that things like reason or logic don't matter. Only that a bastard like me would never step forward from here ever again.
<Page6>
With that, I am completely out of moves.
I wonder to myself if it was really the right time to discard my trump card.
―――It wasn't.
But there was no other way.
The only way to survive was to expose my hand here.
That's why I have to search with all my might for what I can get in return.
<Page7>
"―――!"
I cut it down with the least amount of movement possible.
Even if there's no way to get close to him, I'll try to conserve as much energy as I can.
<Page8>
Two minutes left until I reach my limit.
―――The sense of excitement drives away my fear.
My view of life and death is reversed by my desperate struggle.
<Page9>
"...This is not a miracle.
But neither is this common sense.
What is the meaning behind my craving passing like water?"
<Page10>
There is a small gap in the icy barrage.
The man concentrates the cold waves flooding out of himself into a single point, creating an even colder vortex.
<Page11>
"...It's a shame, but die.
Don't go and make my heart pound like that."
The chunks of ice get expelled like a pulley sliding through the frozen atmosphere...!
<Page12>
I slice through the murderous bullets.
As long as I'm standing in front of Arcueid, I have no choice but to stop the things that are being fired.
<Page13>
At this range, the ice spears will reach me in 1.5 seconds.
I can maintain this state as long as my body moves.
In the meantime, I'll think of what I can do.
<Page14>
Vlov hasn't taken a single step.
Why is he not moving? If he thinks I'm a threat, then there's no reason to cut corners. If anything, it should be the opposite. I predict that it's not because he doesn't need to move due to having projectiles, but rather that he can't move when he's in this state.//ruby dots <あ|・><の|・><状|・><態|・>
<Page15>
He was driven into a corner by Arcueid and ran out of the blood that fuels him. That cold air must have been the final self-defense mechanism of a monster on the verge of death.
<Page16>
It's a wild theory but the logic makes sense.
The immobilized Vlov protects himself by deploying a curse in all directions.
Regardless of whether it's hot or cold, any living thing that comes close to him will die.
<Page17>
You would freeze to death if you got within ten meters of him.
At this rate, I'll eventually fall unconscious as well. It's the same as when a person is lost in the snow and falls asleep. When a human's body temperature is below 34℃ or above 43℃, their brain cells shut down and they go unconscious.
<Page18>
I observe his entire surroundings and not just the individual.
Without interrupting my thoughts, I let the knife slide automatically the moment I see it.
<Page19>
―――During the process, I revise the conjecture that I had made earlier.
That cold wave is spreading in all directions.
But is the density really as uniform as I thought?
<Page20>
The fact that the floor is the coldest means that there is a difference in temperature even within the cold wave. There's the matter of whether the wave is wholly strong or weak, but more importantly, there is a weakness.
It may protect him from all directions, but that doesn't mean it makes him invincible all around―――
<Page21>
"...So you protect your master on the brink of death. How brave, but futile."
The long lance that struck down Arcueid gets picked up from the shadows once again.
Perhaps that was him being spurred on, because behind him, a remarkably large ice tree sprouts branches―――
"―――Now. I will release, in great numbers...!"
<Page22>
I break my train of thought and pour my focus into intercepting his attack.//text overflow, needs rephrasing
This is impossible. I can't stop them all.
There is always a missile coming from somewhere. ―――I won't allow them near me.
I can't be so naive.
I can't even let them graze me.
If I bleed out, it's over. The cold air will not spare even a single minute before coming for my life.
That's why I must kill. That's why I must struggle.
I clear my mind and look down only at the 'line'.
<Page23>
The total number of prey deployed is twenty-six.
I continue to stare as I develop a strategy for what I can cut first and what I can avoid.
―――Within that gap, I can see it clearly.
The place of death greater than a line.
That spot must be the original point of death that gives birth to the lines.
<Page24>
"―――Kh"
The wall of death looms before me.
But I saw it. Just now, I saw the exact same thing that I've seen before.
In the same way that I'm going to die here,
there is a chance that he can die here as well...!
"AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!"
<Page25>
But I've come to a conclusion.
I, Tohno Shiki, no longer have a means of survival.
The ice spears cut into the flesh of my right flank and my left thigh.
My body heat is drained through my extremities.
My ligaments scream from the repetition of the sudden braking movements.
The cells in my legs are being destroyed due to the ultra-low temperature.
My fingertips grow numb. My limbs do not move as I order them to.
<Page26>
"―――, Ha―――"
An inevitable predicament.
A losing battle with no chance for victory.
A situation where I will die in a minute no matter what.
Neither Vlov, nor Arcueid, nor whoever else happens to watch this mess unfold will doubt my inevitable death.
And above all else, I have no hope of survival myself.
And yet―――
<Page27>
"Ha――――――a"
An animalistic urge sprouts from deep within.
Why am I smiling# at a time like this?
<Page28>
"Kya!?"
The spear of ice strikes Arcueid in the face.
Damn. I didn't even consider that Arcueid was located behind me.
<Page29>
Although it didn't pierce her, Arcueid rubs her face with one hand.
How is she unhurt after taking a direct hit to the face? This woman.
<Page30>
"Ow...!"
I knew that she was a ridiculous creature, but once again, I am amazed.
Arcueid plunges one hand into the ground and lifts a chunk of the earth like she was scooping it up with a shovel.
<Page31>
She then aims the bedrock at Vlov and throws it as if to say 'that doesn't hurt at all'.
<Page32>
The huge lance crushes the bedrock thrown by Arcueid.
Vlov is unharmed.
As expected, you can't kill him with such a simple attack.
―――However.
With Arcueid's counterattack, the final piece has been placed.
<Page33>
We have already come to a conclusion.
There is only one way to kill him. If I can get close enough before the cold wave stops my body, I can kill him with absolute certainty.
<Page34>
But how?
My legs are too slow to be able to close that distance within two seconds. I need the help of something faster.
If we want to be more certain, I need to invade through the weakest section of his ultra-cold sphere. I cannot simply use my own legs for this.//ruby dots <自|・><分|・><の|・><脚|・><な|・><ど|・><使|・><っ|・><て|・><は|・><い|・><ら|・><れ|・><な|・><い|・>
<Page35>
I will die for sure if I do nothing. I have no choice.
It is not a matter of whether I can kill him.
It is a matter of how I can kill him.
<Page36>
I must steel my resolve.
If there is any way to get close, it's by...
C:> ...Throwing.
C:> ...Gliding.//滑走, gets updated to 落下 inside the file
C:> ...Towing.
