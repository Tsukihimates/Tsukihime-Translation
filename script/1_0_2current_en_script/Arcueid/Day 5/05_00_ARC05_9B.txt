A block of ice flies through the air.
The ice forms a spear, a bullet fired to blow my brains out.//氷は槍と化し、弾丸となって俺の頭を撃ち抜きにくる。
―――Should I avoid it, or take it head-on?
Do I continue to hide it, or do I cast away my only weapon?
I subconsciously make a decision.
<Page2>
"―――!"
My headache clamps down further on my brain.//頭痛が脳を締め上げる。
Fully immersed, I focus my eyes on the deadly weapon.//
If those lines represent the 'death of existence',
then I will kill the form, the inertia and the sub-zero bonds of the spear right in front of me...!
<Page3>
Death grazes my temple.
I match my knife to the soaring icicles. A man is but a wild beast. We were equipped with such kinetic vision and reflexes a long time ago.
<Page4>
If my body can still move adequately, then a weapon like this is no different than a giant pebble.
However―――
<Page5>
However, this brings an end to my frontal 'surprise attack'.
The man's eyes speak to me.
They tell me that he saw it.
They tell me that things like reason or logic don't matter. He simply won't let a bastard like me get close a second time.//理由も理屈もどうでもいい。ただ、貴様を二度とそこから先には進ませない、と。
<Page6>
With that, I am completely out of moves.
I wonder to myself if it was really the right time to discard my trump card.
―――It wasn't.
But there was no other way.
The only way to survive was to expose my hand here.
That's why I have to search with all my might for what I can get in return.
<Page7>
"―――!"
I cut it down with the least amount of movement possible.
Even if there's no way to get close to him, I'll try to conserve as much energy as I can.
<Page8>
Two minutes left until I reach my limit.
―――The sense of excitement drives away my fear.
My view of life and death is reversed by my desperate struggle to survive.//死に物狂いのあがきに、死生観が逆転する。
<Page9>
"...This is not a miracle.
But neither is this common sense.
Why is it that he is able to slip like water through my onslaught?"
<Page10>
There is a small gap in the icy barrage.
The man concentrates the cold waves flooding out of himself into a single point, creating an even colder vortex.
<Page11>
"...It's a shame, but die.
Don't go and make my heart pound like that."
Chunks of ice shoot toward me as though gliding down a zip line that cuts through the frozen atmosphere.
<Page12>
I slice through the murderous bullets.
As long as I'm standing in front of Arcueid, I have no choice but to stop the things that are being fired.
<Page13>
At this range, it takes 1.5 seconds for the ice spears to reach me.
I can keep this up for as long as my body moves.
In the meantime, I'll think of what I can do.
<Page14>
Vlov hasn't taken a single step.
Why is he not moving? If he thinks I'm a threat, then there's no reason to ease up. If anything, it should be the opposite. I predict that it's not because he doesn't need to move due to having projectiles, but rather that he can't move when he's in this state.//ruby dots <あ|・><の|・><状|・><態|・>
<Page15>
He was driven into a corner by Arcueid and ran out of the blood that fuels him. That cold air must be the final self-defense mechanism of a monster on the verge of death.
<Page16>
It's a wild theory but the logic makes sense.
The immobilized Vlov protects himself by deploying a curse in all directions.
Regardless of whether it's hot or cold, any living thing that comes close to him will die.
<Page17>
You would freeze to death in 2 seconds if you got within ten meters of him.//10メートル以内に近づけば２秒で凍死。
At this rate, I'll eventually fall as well. It's no different to how people struck by disaster in the snow-capped mountains eventually succumb to sleep. When a human's body temperature is below 34℃ or above 43℃, their brain cells shut down and they fall unconscious.//雪山で遭難した人間が眠ってしまうのと同じだ。人の場合、体温が摂氏34度以下、あるいは摂氏43度以上で脳細胞が停止し、意識が消失してしまう。
<Page18>
Rather than focusing only on Vlov, I observe his surroundings as well.
Without interrupting my thoughts, I let the knife slide automatically the moment I see something.
<Page19>
―――During the process, I revise the conjecture that I had made earlier.
That cold wave is spreading in all directions.
But is the density really as uniform as I thought?
<Page20>
The fact that the floor is the coldest area means that there is a difference in temperature even within the cold wave. There's still the matter of whether the wave is wholly strong or weak, but importantly, it's not perfect.// 地表が最も低温だという事は、寒波の中にも温度差はある。強いか弱いかの基準ではあるが欠点は存在する。
It may protect him from all directions, but that doesn't mean it makes him invincible all around―――
<Page21>
"...So you protect your master on the brink of death. How brave, but futile."
The long lance that struck down Arcueid is drawn from the shadows once again.
Perhaps he was just warming up before, because behind him, a remarkably large ice tree sprouts branches―――//'Priming the pump' それが呼び水になったのか、ヤツの背後にひときわ大きな樹氷が枝を張り―――
"―――Now. I will release, in great numbers...!"
<Page22>
I put my thoughts on hold and pour all of my attention into intercepting his attack.//Do not touch this page without playtesting
This is impossible. I can't stop them all.
I'll surely be hit somewhere. ―――No.//必ずどこかに被弾する。―――許されない。
I can't be so naive.
I can't even let them graze me.
If I bleed out, it's over. The cold air will not spare even a single minute before coming for my life.
That's why I must kill. That's why I must struggle.
I clear my mind and construct an image only out of the 'lines'.
<Page23>
The total number of prey deployed is twenty-six.
I continue to stare as I develop a strategy for what I should cut first and what I can avoid.
―――Within that gap, I can see it clearly.
The place of death greater than a line.
That spot must be the locus of death that gives birth to the lines.//あの点こそが、線を生み出す死の極点だと。
<Page24>
"―――Kh"
The wall of death looms before me.
But I saw it. Just now, I saw the exact same thing that I've seen before.
There's a chance that I die here.
But there's a chance that bastard dies here too...!
"AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!"
<Page25>
But I've come to a conclusion.
I, Tohno Shiki, no longer have a means of survival.
The ice spears cut into the flesh of my right flank and my left thigh.
My body heat is drained through my extremities.
My ligaments scream as a result of my repeated sudden braking movements.
The cells in my legs are being destroyed due to the ultra-low temperature.
My fingertips grow numb. My limbs do not move as I order them to.
<Page26>
"―――, Ha―――"//Do not edit this page without playtesting
An inevitable predicament.
A losing battle with no chance for victory.
A situation where I will die in a minute no matter what.
Neither Vlov, nor Arcueid, nor whoever else happens to watch this mess unfold will doubt my inevitable death.
Above all, I myself have no hope for my own survival.//なにより俺自身、生き延びる希望がない。
And yet―――
<Page27>
"Ha――――――a"
An animalistic urge sprouts from deep within me.
Why am I smiling# at a time like this?
<Page28>
"Kya!?"
One of the ice spears strikes Arcueid square in the face.
Damn. I didn't even consider the fact that she was located behind me.//しまった。背後のアルクェイドとの位置関係までは見ていられなかった。
<Page29>
Although it didn't pierce her, Arcueid rubs her face with one hand.
How is she unhurt after taking a direct hit to the face? This woman.
<Page30>
"Ow...!"
I knew that she was a ridiculous creature, but once again, I am amazed.
Arcueid plunges her bare hand into the ground and lifts a chunk of earth as though scooping it up with a shovel.
<Page31>
She then aims the bedrock at Vlov and throws it as if to say 'that doesn't hurt at all'.
<Page32>
The huge lance crushes the bedrock thrown by Arcueid.
Vlov is unharmed.
As expected, you can't kill him with such a simple attack.
―――However.
With Arcueid's counterattack, the final piece has been placed.
<Page33>
We have already come to a conclusion.
There is only one way to kill him. If I can get close enough before the cold wave stops my body, I can kill him with absolute certainty.
<Page34>
But how?
My legs are too slow to be able to close that distance within two seconds. I need the help of something faster.
If we want to be more certain, I need to invade through the weakest section of his ultra-cold sphere. I cannot simply use my own legs for this.//ruby dots <自|・><分|・><の|・><脚|・><な|・><ど|・><使|・><っ|・><て|・><は|・><い|・><ら|・><れ|・><な|・><い|・>
<Page35>
I will die for sure if I do nothing. I have no choice.
It is not a matter of whether I can kill him.
It is a matter of how I can kill him.
<Page36>
I must steel my resolve.
If there is any way to get close, it's by...
C:> ...Throwing.
C:> ...Gliding.//滑走, gets updated to 落下 inside the file
C:> ...Towing.
