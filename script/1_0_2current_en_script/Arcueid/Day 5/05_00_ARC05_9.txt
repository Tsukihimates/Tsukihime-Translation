"――――"
The cold air cuts my skin.
My body temperature drops.
The intense cold makes it difficult just to survive.//ruby dots <た|・><だ|・><生|・><き|・><る|・>
My brain creaks increasingly like it was being pressurized inside my skull.
<Page2>
I predict the outcome in the next two minutes and tear into my heart that was ready to burst.
<Page3>
Corpses swarm toward Arcueid. 
A procession reminiscent of midsummer in the midst of the extreme cold.
It was like ants gathering sugar under a blazing sun.
Arcueid will be killed.  
Those corpses will tear her limb from limb and offer her dismembered body just as I did.
<Page4>
All while I watch from a safe distance.
Just like that―――#Just like that?
<Page5>
"―――, I can't."
That thing is a disaster taking the shape of a human being.
I shouldn't have pursued him.
It was beyond arrogant of me to think that I could defeat him.
<Page6>
Stopping him from killing anyone else?
Solving the problem without any more casualties?
How foolish. I should have let that monster go. I shouldn't have confronted it. I should have waited for it to pass by like a typhoon. If I had done that, then at least the city might end up only being burned to the ground.
<Page7>
"――――――But, I can't."
A person who couldn't do anything. Me, who chose to do nothing.
A person who wasn't even armed. Me, who carried a weapon.
Common sense and irrationality flail about from within my pressurized brain.
My consciousness turns to my rear, telling me to run. There's nothing I can do to stop that.
It's no use. What can she do against that thing? That woman. This is more than enough. Anything more would be overkill. That woman. All she has to do is run away. Just turn away. That's what any decent person would do. That woman is going to be killed.//ruby dots <ま|・><っ|・><と|・><う|・><な|・><人|・><間|・>
<Page8>
I look up at the sky. Frozen buildings surround my vision.
The people that passed away in an instant. They probably didn't even have time to scream.
The scene at the hotel last night. I think back to the pleas of the people who were killed without reason.
The body of the fallen woman. The corpses drooling sloppily as they rub against the <woman|flesh>. The expanding river of ice. Despite all this, the vampire continues to observe the death of the city with indifference―――
<Page9>
"――――――There's no doubt about it."
My skull cracks. In this low temperature, my heart pumps out blood in a raging fit.
That is, in other words...
<Page10>
"――――――I cannot allow this."
The fear running down my spine gets converted into anger in its entirety.
I'm a defect. A laughingstock. Too inadequate for a human. #After all. #I don't have the slightest hint of tolerance or judgment to just stand by and watch this happen―――!
<Page11>
I take off my glasses.
I desperately try to suppress the trembling and the warmth escaping from my mouth with my left hand.
<Page12>
One minute, no, three minutes.
I firmly etch this time into my mind.
It's not a matter of mental strength. That is the limit of human activity inside that pit.
<Page13>
"Shit―――shit, shit, shit―――!
What the hell am I doing―――!"
<Page14>
I descend the slope as I condemn myself. 
This is ridiculous. I'm being foolish. I really am an idiot.
<Page15>
Do I run away because I don't want to die?
Wrong. If that's the reason then it should be the exact opposite.
That thing is something that should not be tolerated.
That thing is something that can't be allowed to go unchecked.
Running away will undoubtedly lead to my death. Not only for myself, but for this entire city.
<Page16>
In that case, then it is obvious what I must do.
If you don't want to die, then kill it. Run for the sake of survival.
Kill that thing right here without a second to spare.
<Page17>
I've pretty much run out of patience at this point.
That thing killed, robbed, and survived without a second thought.
As a different <organism|person>, I cannot allow him to exist under the same plane of existence.
Whatever it may be, if it is alive then it is my prey.
Right here, I'll end the root of his existence...!
<Page18>
I run towards Arcueid.
The corpses are trying to sink their teeth into her body.
<Page19>
The question of whether I could kill them from earlier comes into mind.
Can I kill something that looks like a person whether it's human or not?
<Page20>
―――It doesn't matter.
My head simply hurts right now.
This is the first time I've exposed my naked eyes for this long.
This is the first time I ever acted with such objective thoughts.
As I look down on the lines of death in a frenzy,
I store the images of the corpses I must kill into my memory.
Don't touch her. You're an eyesore. The dead should not eat the living.
Besides―――
The only creature that is allowed to prey on that woman is me.//ruby dots <そ|・><の|・><女|・><を|・><獲|・><物|・><に|・><す|・><る|・><な|・>
<Page21>
I cut the lines of the three corpses.
Their torsos are split into three parts. The corpses are cut open like butter and pass away.
It's that simple. Their attention was focused on Arcueid after all. There should be a limit even for such a lack of defense.
<Page22>
"Wake up! How long are you going to stay asleep for...!"
There's no need to come in contact with Arcueid. 
I call out to her as I kill the fourth corpse.
<Page23>
"Mmm... Shi...ki?"
Whether it was my call that brought her back to consciousness or not, Arcueid faintly opens her eyes.
<Page24>
"W-What are you doing here? No, go back...!"
<Page25>
As Arcueid begins to sit up, her face contorts as she curls her body.
She's back to being conscious. Her life is still intact. But her wound is not healed.
<Page26>
She can't move from here yet.
The one that should be running is her and not me. But unfortunately for her, I cannot allow that to happen.
<Page27>
"Okay, you're fine. That's good. Back me up if you can."
"You're telling me that you're going in alone? Are you insane!?"
"Would I be here if I wasn't?
Listen, this place is like the bottom of the ocean for me. I only have 3 minutes. That's why in that time―――"
<Page28>
"This time. We'll kill that bastard together and end this."
<Page29>
I leave Arcueid behind and run.
I fix the grip on my knife and confirm the distance between me and Vlov.
The distance is 40 meters.
Six seconds until contact. He still hasn't seen me yet.
<Page30>
―――Three seconds left.
No time to wait and see. I'll finish him off with one blow.
My body is already in a state of flux.
<Page31>
Three minutes remain until my consciousness and my body get shut down by the low temperature.
I have less than a minute left to move freely.
That's more than enough. For me, there is no doubt,
that I can see the lines of death that will 'kill' the monster.
<Page32>
The man finally responds.
He turns his gaze to intercept me with a motion as if he was warding off an insect.
The giant lance that skewered Arcueid is missing.
Of course it is. It would be a bother if it wasn't.
<Page33>
I am no different than the corpses in Vlov's eyes.
An incompetent 'thing' that only protects Arcueid.
I am a worthless being just like the frail <humans|creatures> he trampled on.
<Page34>
"――――――Ha."
That's why I have a chance of winning.
The only thing I can do is take him by surprise.
He's already seen me. I can't attack him from behind.
<Page35>
And yet I can still take him by surprise.//ruby dots <俺|・><に|・><は|・><奇|・><襲|・><が|・><で|・><き|・><る|・>
He doesn't know about my eyes.
He doesn't even consider that a mere human has the means to kill an immortal vampire with a single blow.
<Page36>
Two seconds left.
I only have to take one risk, to cross the border between life and death.
I'll dodge his first move. That's the only thing I'll focus on.
If I can just make it through that gamble, then all I have to do is cut that line―――
<Page37>
"―――!"
At the very last second.
Right at the moment before we cross swords, the both of us jump back simultaneously.
We never even came within each other's striking distance.
<Page38>
There are two reasons.
For one, I was mistaken.
I can't get close to his chest. The cold wind is blowing violently from his core. The closer I get, the slower my body becomes. When I get within two meters of him at my running speed, I'll lose consciousness and be unable to take another step.
The minimum requirement for a surprise attack.
The requirement of getting close to kill cannot be achieved against Vlov.//ruby dots <近|・><づ|・><い|・><て|・><殺|・><す|・>
<Page39>
But that's okay. As a matter of fact, I had taken that possibility into consideration.
However, there is another problem.
This one is far more deadly.
<Page40>
"You bastard―――!"
The headache caused by my exposed eyes becomes mixed with my personal rage.
<Page41>
I don't believe this. Of all the things that could happen, that bastard managed to read through me.
It must have been his intuition.
An awareness of death that surpasses that of a beast.
That guy jumped back without a second of hesitation, precisely because he had a sudden intuition that the enemy had the means to kill him, shivered, and recognized me as a threat in a situation without any basis......!//ruby dots <敵|・><に|・><は|・><自|・><分|・><を|・><殺|・><す|・><手|・><段|・><が|・><あ|・><る|・><と|・><直|・><感|・><し|・>
<Page42>
"...Why, did I retreat...?"
My retreat was a mere two meters at best.
But his retreat was extraordinary. The guy flew back at a distance of 30 meters.
I guess that must be the 'minimum safety zone' for a vampire. I utterly laugh at the sheer difference in scale between lifeforms.
<Page43>
"...You. What are you...?"
"――――――"
That should be my line.
<Page44>
In any case, this is the worst possible situation. The distance can no longer be bridged.
I recognized that it is impossible to defeat him,
and he sensed that I have a method of killing him.
From here on out, without a doubt,
<Page45>
"...Good. Stay back. You can stand there and die."//ruby dots <そ|・><こ|・><で|・><死|・><ん|・><で|・><い|・><ろ|・>
It would be a one-sided slaughter from afar.
