"――――"
The cold air cuts my skin.
My body temperature drops.
The intense cold makes it difficult just to survive.//ruby dots <た|・><だ|・><生|・><き|・><る|・>
My brain creaks as if it's being squeezed by my skull.
<Page2>
Predicting the outcome of the next two minutes, I want to tear out my heart, which is already ready to burst.
<Page3>
Corpses swarm toward Arcueid.
A procession reminiscent of midsummer in the midst of the extreme cold.
They're like ants gathering sugar under the blazing sun.
Arcueid will be killed.
Those corpses will tear her limb from limb, just as I had, and offer her dismembered body.
<Page4>
All while I watch from a safe distance.
Just like that―――#Just like that?
<Page5>
"―――I can't."
That thing is a disaster in human form.
I shouldn't have pursued him.
It was beyond arrogant of me to think that I could defeat him.
<Page6>
Stopping him from killing anyone else?
Solving the problem without any more casualties?
How foolish. I should have let that monster go. I shouldn't have confronted it. I should have waited for it to pass by like a typhoon. If I had done that, then the city may have only ended up being burned to the ground.
<Page7>
"―――But, I can't."//text overflow, needs rephrasing
A person who couldn't do anything. Me, who chose to do nothing.
A person who wasn't even armed. Me, who carried a weapon.
Common sense and irrationality flail about within my pressurized brain.
My consciousness turns to my rear, telling me to run. There's nothing I can do to stop that.
It's no use. What can she do against that thing? That woman. This is more than enough. Anything more would be overkill. That woman. All she has to do is run away. Just turn away. That's what any decent person would do. That woman is going to be killed.//ruby dots <ま|・><っ|・><と|・><う|・><な|・><人|・><間|・>
<Page8>
I look up at the sky. Frozen buildings surround my vision.
The people that had passed away in an instant. They probably didn't even have time to scream.
The scene at the hotel last night. I think back to the pleas of those people who were killed without reason.
The body of the fallen woman. The corpses drool as they rub against the <woman|f l e s h  >. The expanding river of ice. Throughout, the vampire continues to observe the death of the city with indifference―――
<Page9>
"――――――There's no doubt about it."
My skull cracks. In this low temperature, my heart pumps out blood in a raging fit.
That is, in other words...
<Page10>
"――――――I cannot allow this."
The fear running down my spine turns entirely into anger.
I'm a defect. A laughingstock. Too inadequate to be a human.# After all.# Not a single atom in my body can tolerate just observing―――!
<Page11>
I take off my glasses.
I desperately try to prevent warmth from escaping my trembling mouth with my left hand.
<Page12>
One minute, no, three minutes.
I firmly etch this time into my mind.
It's not a matter of mental strength. That is the limit of human activity inside that pit.
<Page13>
"Shit―――shit, shit, shit―――!
What the hell am I doing―――!"
<Page14>
I descend down the slope as I condemn myself.
This is ridiculous. I'm being foolish. I really am an idiot.
<Page15>
Do I run away because I don't want to die?
Wrong. If that's the reason then it should be the exact opposite.
That thing is something that should not be tolerated.
That thing is something that cannot be allowed to go unchecked.
Running away will undoubtedly lead to death. Not only for myself, but for this entire city.
<Page16>
In that case, then it's obvious what I must do.
If you don't want to die, then kill it. Run for the sake of survival.
Kill that thing right here without a second to spare.
<Page17>
I've pretty much run out of patience at this point.
That thing killed, robbed, and survived without a second thought.
As a different <organism|p e r s o n  >, I cannot allow him to reside in the same plane of existence.
Whatever it may be, if it's alive then it's my prey.
Right here, I'll end the root of his existence...!
<Page18>
I run toward Arcueid.
The corpses are trying to sink their teeth into her body.
<Page19>
The question from earlier of whether I could kill them or not comes to mind.
Can I kill something that looks like a person, regardless of whether or not it is human?
<Page20>
―――It doesn't matter.//text overflow, needs rephrasing
My head simply hurts right now.
This is the first time I've exposed my naked eyes for this long.
This is the first time I've acted with such objective thought.
As I look down on the lines of death in a frenzy,
I store the images of the corpses I must kill into my memory.
Don't touch her. You're an eyesore. The dead should not eat the living.
Besides―――
The only creature that is allowed to prey on that woman is me.//ruby dots <そ|・><の|・><女|・><を|・><獲|・><物|・><に|・><す|・><る|・><な|・>
<Page21>
I cut the lines of the three corpses.
Their torsos are split into three parts. Their bodies are cut open like butter. // 死亡する is dropped from the end here.
It's that simple. Their attention was focused on Arcueid after all. How can you even be that defenseless?
<Page22>
"Wake up! How long are you going to stay asleep for...!"
There's no need to come in contact with Arcueid.
I call out to her as I kill the fourth corpse.
<Page23>
"Mmm... Shi... ki?"
Whether it was my call that brought her back to consciousness or not, Arcueid faintly opens her eyes.
<Page24>
"W-What are you doing here? No, run away...!"
<Page25>
As Arcueid begins to sit up, her face contorts as she curls her body.
She's back to being conscious. Her life is still intact. But her wound is not healed.
<Page26>
She can't move from here yet.
The one that should be running is her and not me. But unfortunately for her, I cannot allow that to happen.
<Page27>
"Okay, you're fine. That's good. Back me up if you can."
"You're telling me that you're going in alone? Are you insane!?"
"Would I be here if I wasn't?
Listen, this place is like the bottom of the ocean for me. I only have three minutes. That's why in that time―――"
<Page28>
"This time for sure. We'll kill that bastard together and end this."
<Page29>
I leave Arcueid behind and run.
I adjust my grip on the knife and measure the distance between me and Vlov.
The distance is 40 meters.
Six seconds until contact. He still hasn't seen me yet.
<Page30>
―――Three seconds left.
No time to wait and see. I'll finish him off with one blow.
My body is already in a state of flux.
<Page31>
Three minutes remain until my body and consciousness shut down due to the low temperature.
I have less than a minute left to move freely.
That's more than enough. For me, there is no doubt,
that I can see the lines of death that will 'kill' the monster.
<Page32>
The man finally responds.
He turns his gaze to intercept me with a motion as if he is warding off an insect.
The giant lance that skewered Arcueid is missing.
Of course it is. It would be a bother if it wasn't.
<Page33>
I am no different than the corpses in Vlov's eyes.
An incompetent 'thing' that only protects Arcueid.
I am a worthless being just like the frail <humans|c r e a t u r e s  > he trampled on.
<Page34>
"――――――Ha."
That's why I have a chance of winning.
The only thing I can do is take him by surprise.
He's already seen me. I can't attack him from behind.
<Page35>
And yet I can still take him by surprise.//ruby dots <俺|・><に|・><は|・><奇|・><襲|・><が|・><で|・><き|・><る|・>
He doesn't know about my eyes.
He doesn't even consider that a mere human has the means to kill an immortal vampire with a single blow.
<Page36>
Two seconds left.
I only have to take one risk, to cross the border between life and death.
I'll dodge his first move. That's the only thing I'll focus on.
If I can just make it through that gamble, then all I have to do is cut that line―――
<Page37>
"―――!"
At the very last second.
Right at the moment before we cross swords, the both of us jump back simultaneously.
We never even came within each other's striking distance.
<Page38>
There are two reasons.
For one, I was mistaken.
I can't get close to his chest. The cold wind is blowing violently from his core. The closer I get, the slower my body becomes. When I get within two meters of him at my running speed, I'll lose consciousness and won't be able to take another step.
The minimum requirement for a surprise attack.
Simply getting close isn't possible against Vlov.//ruby dots <近|・><づ|・><い|・><て|・><殺|・><す|・>
<Page39>
But that's okay. As a matter of fact, I had taken that possibility into consideration.
However, there is another problem.
This one is far more deadly.
<Page40>
'You bastard―――!'
The headache caused by my exposed eyes blends with my personal rage.
<Page41>
I don't believe this. Of all the things that could happen, that bastard managed to see through me.
It must have been his intuition.
An awareness of death that surpasses that of a beast.
That guy jumped back without a second of hesitation, precisely because he had a sudden intuition that the enemy had the means to kill him. He shivered and recognized me as a threat without any basis...!//ruby dots <敵|・><に|・><は|・><自|・><分|・><を|・><殺|・><す|・><手|・><段|・><が|・><あ|・><る|・><と|・><直|・><感|・><し|・>
<Page42>
"Why... did I retreat...?"
My retreat was a mere two meters at best.
But his retreat was extraordinary. The guy flew back a distance of 30 meters.
I guess that must be the 'minimum safety zone' for a vampire. I laugh at the sheer difference in ability between us two lifeforms.//to be rechecked, we use scale differently (lifescale thing) different word needed
<Page43>
"...You. What are you...?"
"――――――"
That should be my line.
<Page44>
This is the worst possible situation. I can't bridge the distance anymore.
I recognized that it's impossible to defeat him,
and he sensed that I have a method of killing him.
From here on out, without a doubt――
<Page45>
"...Good. Stay back. You can stand there and die."//ruby dots <そ|・><こ|・><で|・><死|・><ん|・><で|・><い|・><ろ|・>
It will be a one-sided slaughter from afar.
