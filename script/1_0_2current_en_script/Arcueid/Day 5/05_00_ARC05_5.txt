The city is in a frenzied panic.
I run through the crowded streets.
The fire in front of the station can be seen even from here.
<Page2>
The screens outside broadcast the breaking news on repeat.
A fire had broken out in the vicinity of Souya Station's north gate.
The trains are suspended and the people who were visiting the downtown area are frantically running for their lives.
<Page3>
A news anchor is reporting the emergency on the outdoor screens.//text overflow, the entire page needs rephrasing
It's an interview with a high school girl who has just escaped the fire.
"It's hot, it's hot. Hey, why is it so hot?
My friend, Yuka, just got eaten by them. They even got my arm. It's like...
They're moving even though they're dead! They're burning but they're laughing...!"
Her words were treated as shock-induced delusions.
<Page4>
The fire is spreading even now, to the point where nearby residents are being told to evacuate.
Even with that, the main street is overflowing with people.
From the surrounding area, people come out of curiosity to watch, photograph and forward the situation to their closest friends.
<Page5>
"...!"
The road to the station is already blocked off.
Fire prevention... no, it would be too early for that. More importantly, there are too many people around.
It's almost like they're guarding the exits to make sure nobody inside can escape.
<Page6>
"Crap...!"
Either way, can't go this way.
"Shiki, over here."
She pulls my hand with force.
<Page7>
Without asking for my permission, Arcueid grips my hand as she slips through the crowd of people.
<Page8>
"H-Hang on a second!
Why did you take me all the way here?"
<Page9>
I shake my hand free.
As Arcueid looks up at the wall of the building, she says,
<Page10>
"Yeah. This will work.
This is my first time flying with another person, but it shouldn't be an issue if we're only going this high."
"Huh?"
<Page11>
She moves without hesitation.
Arcueid grasps my arm as if she were pinning me down, and then...
<Page12>
"We're going to fly. Hold on tight, Shiki."
She just says something completely outrageous―――!
<Page13>
"Wah."
<Page14>
"Waah."
<Page15>
"WAAAAAAAAAAAHHH―――――!?"
<Page16>
We're flying.
No, we're jumping.
<Page17>
Arcueid bounds from wall to wall up the adjoining buildings. Before I realize it, we're above the buildings, no, soaring across the sky.
Of course, she did all of this while holding onto me.
<Page18>
"W-W-Wait a, waaaaaah...!"
It's so high! I'm terrified! How many meters above ground is this? That building must have been around 40 meters and we're above that!? Even a 20-meter drop-tower ride would make my heart shrink, let alone this! Where the hell am I supposed to put my feet?!
<Page19>
"Hmm? Shiki, you'll bite your tongue off if you open your mouth like that."
<Page20>
As I tilt my head to cover my screaming, Arcueid ramps up the brutal pace even more.
We hop off of each rooftop from building to building. Just like a rabbit hopping on the moon.
<Page21>
"Uoh, Uooh, Uoooooooooh―――!?"
I endure this surreal experience with gritted teeth.
Just as I was starting to enjoy it, at long last, Arcueid stops leaping.
<Page22>
It's the rooftop of a skyscraper overlooking the city.
We have landed on an aerial garden that was not originally designed for humans to enter.
<Page23>
"Eh―――you, w-what the hell was that about―――"
<Page24>
This rollercoaster experience has played havoc with my breathing.
My chest is in pain. My fluctuating blood pressure strains my heart.
Although there's no change in air pressure, my entire body has frozen up from this shock to my system.
<Page25>
"Look. Over there."
"What do you mean, look ther―――"
<Page26>
I stop just before I could finish my sentence.
At that moment, I forget all about the pain of my elevated heart rate.
<Page27>
―――It's burning.
The city I live in, the familiar buildings, are all being consumed by the sea of flames.
"What――――――"
I can now see the full extent of the horror.//to be rechecked
<Page28>
The main street is wrapped in a red veil.
Little by little, the flames burn away the outline of the buildings as if they're being cut by a blade.
<Page29>
It is a river of fire. Within it is a man ceaselessly consuming. He bathes himself in the crimson rain, showing off his appetite being satisfied.
There are several people in front of the man.
They are police officers that were setting up a barricade.
The officers raise their pistols and fire in unison.
<Page30>
"―――Wha―――"
However, the man does not budge.
The cops most likely don't even register to him.
More figures appear from behind the <monster|V l o v  >.
<Page31>
Burning Corpses.
Perhaps they are people who were alive just a few minutes ago, but now they have become moving corpses.
As if they were begging for help...
the corpses move towards the firing officers―――
<Page32>
"―――What the hell―――is this―――"
I feel a white flame burning in my throat.
I didn't even have the chance to look away.
The sense of duty and urgency I had while running towards the city have been wiped clean.
Right now, the only thing left in my mind is pure fear.
<Page33>
That's a vampire's true nature.
A thing that simply kills people just by existing.
And now it is an enemy that we must defeat no matter what―――
<Page34>
"...There's no sign of them. Those guys from the church.
If they really were so adamant about hunting vampires, they would have been here by now... I guess they're not in this country after all.
But that doesn't explain the unusually strict control of traffic... Perhaps the executioners they sent are just some pencil-pushers rather than real agents."
<Page35>
Arcueid is not looking at the river of fire.
Instead, she's focusing her attention on something completely different.
<Page36>
"So what's the plan, Shiki?
As you can see, this is Vlov's true nature. He's a mass murderer that had no intention of finding me in the first place."
<Page37>
"If we leave him be, he'll eventually run out of blood and become weak.
Given Vlov's <abilities|l i f e s c a l e >, this city will probably burn to the ground before he becomes weak enough that I can defeat him alone.
Will you be watching from the sidelines? Or―――"
<Page38>
She asks whether I'm willing to risk my life to save others.
Although she already knows what I'm about to say, Arcueid confirms it one final time.
And so, with all the determination I can muster, I glare at her, my body shuddering.
<Page39>
"...Hah, it seems that I can't make you change your mind.
To think that you'd still fight after seeing that. Perhaps I was wrong about both you and Vlov.
But what are you going to do?
In this condition, I don't mind beginning right now."
<Page40>
Begin right now...?
"Are you telling me you're gonna move the battlefield here... no wait, that you already have!?"
<Page41>
"Is there anything you can do about this situation!?"
"Yes, if all goes well. I don't want to attract any attention either."
"I beg you...! Please go in and fight him right now...!"
<Page42>
"Understood. Then I'll drop all of them underground.
There seems to be some kind of hollow space underneath."
<Page43>
...Wait. She's going to drop them... underground?
No, this is no time to be asking questions.
Right now, we need to get them off the street as fast as possible...!
<Page44>
"But don't forget our promise. Make sure you find me afterwards."
<Page45>
I was so amazed, my mind was racing.
That's outrageous―――
Leaving me behind, Arcueid leaps off from the rooftop and into the void.
<Page46>
She's like a white flower, dancing in the wind.
<Page47>
An air current catches her body as she throws herself from the rooftop.
The chains of gravity are broken,
the grounding anchors are raised,
and the thing that should have fallen, rises gently instead.
Like a sailing ship catching the wind, she gambols through the night sky.
<Page48>
There's nothing to be surprised about.
That incarnation is a projection of a child from another planet.
All the fluctuations that occur on the surface belong to her.
<Page49>
The blessings of nature that give way to life,
the wrath of nature that takes it away,
the naturally endowed rights of that body.
<Page50>
"Okay―――"
The beautiful flower turns itself to look at the moon.
Her consciousness turns from the sky to the ground.
The unraveled chains and the raised anchors strike the surface of the Earth.
Below her is a tall, stone building scattering fire.
"―――Let's do this!"
<Page51>
The blooming flower in the night sky turns into a falling star.
The flower of the moon transforms itself into a tempest, blowing away the burning blaze.
