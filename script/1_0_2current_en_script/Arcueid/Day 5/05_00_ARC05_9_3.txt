It's by towing.
That's the only way. A brilliant idea, even for me.
That's right. If we can't get to him, then we'll have him come to us.
<Page2>
It's impossible for me to do it alone, but if Arcueid still has that much power left, it might be possible...!
<Page3>
I run towards Arcueid in the rear.
"Shiki―――!"
I hear the sound of ice being smashed behind me.
The claw-shaped wind pressure generated by Arcueid seems to be accurate not only within her reach, but also at this distance.
<Page4>
"Why did you come over here, Shiki?
And why do you have such a proud look on your face!?"
"I'll explain later, so just do that thing!
The ivy that caught Vlov just now!"
<Page5>
Now is not the time to waste.
I shout while making a gesture of wanting to tie Vlov with the ivy.
<Page6>
"From this range!?# Ah, that was close...!"
"I need you to somehow use it as a lasso!"
"Huh!? Geez, I don't know what's going on, but I just have to catch him right!?"
<Page7>
I don't know if it was because she sensed my desperation, but Arcueid holds up her hand towards Vlov in her confused state, and then...
<Page8>
"That's it! You're amazing, Arcueid!"
"Ehehe. But what do we do now?"
<Page9>
"That's obvious―――pull as hard as you can!"
"As hard as I can, like this!?"
<Page10>
If Arcueid can throw rubble with that much force, she should be able to pull Vlov at a high speed.
That method is much faster than if I were to run.
<Page11>
The question is whether Vlov has the power to stand his ground.
There's no way he would let go of his advantage over distance. He will definitely resist Arcueid's pull with all his strength.
<Page12>
This is a tug of war between two vampires.
The weaker one will be pulled into the other's position―――
<Page13>
"―――Eh?"
In an instant. The black coat from 50 meters away vanishes.
The enemy that needed to be defeated appears in front of us faster than we could prepare ourselves.
<Page14>
There is no safe zone in this space.
It's not that Vlov didn't want to approach us, but that he didn't have the strength to do so, just like me.
But despite this, I gave him a tailwind.
<Page15>
"―――, Ah."
A massive foreign object pierces my chest.
I take a deep breath for the last time in my life.
<Page16>
"―――Are you not aware of the basics of hunting?
The rope should be secured only after killing the prey."
I hear the voice of a hunter disappointed from the bottom of his heart.
<Page17>
Indeed.
I jumped to an easy conclusion without putting my life on the line.
A fitting end for an idiot no better than a stray dog.
