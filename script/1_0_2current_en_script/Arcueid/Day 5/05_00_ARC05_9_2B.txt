<Page1>
I Bend down in front of Arcueid.
Puting my knees and hands on the ground.
<Page2>
An invisible arm runs through the ground.
Arcueid throws the same debris as before, but many times larger, into the ground, in small pieces.
<Page3>
It was an upheaval of the earth itself, reminiscent of an explosion.
The force of the dust. If Vlov's cold air was a blizzard, then Arcueid's action was a tsunami of earth.
<Page4>
A flying spear of ice is but a spray in front of this wall of earth and sand.
Fifty meters high, a mass equivalent to 7,000 tons is surging toward Vrove, ready to swallow him whole.
<Page5>
But the earth-reversing cataclysm does not move him.
With a single thrust of his steel spears, he pushed back the massive waves of sand and earth.
<Page6>
Through the downpour of debris, Vlov must have been able to see,
Arcueid kneeling from the exhaustion of her last effort to turn the bedrock over with both hands, and that perhaps the 'threat' that was approaching hidden within the sediment was nowhere to be seen.
<Page7>
Faced with the towering wave, it regained its former thoughts.
No, two minutes ago, to be exact.
The brain, which was supposed to have lost its sanity due to the constant cold, had been trying to operate normally since that moment when it had jumped away from the human in front of it.
<Page8>
"That human is ready to kill me."
"I don't know what the logic is, but I'm sure of it."
A remnant of a time when he was sane.
The experience of fighting as a knight cultivated in the dark ages of the Middle Ages has broken the curse that runs through his body.
The pride of only twenty years or so had defeated the madness of over a thousand years.
<Page9>
He knows well what kind of miracle that is.
This is just a moment. A blink of an eye before he kills that man. It's an afterlife dream that can't happen.
In a few more seconds, the human joy of fighting will be frozen.
<Page10>
""------,c""
That's why I can't help but be inflamed by this development.
The enemy's aim is clear.
Using this sand and soil as a shield, the enemy will approach us.
His weapon is cutting. This wall is like a door to him. He'll cut through it and come right at us.
<Page11>
He holds his spear.
I know that I should crush the enemy hiding behind it with this great wave.
<Page12>
There is no need to respond to the enemy's tactics.
His strategy is to crush it all.
There is still a lot of power left in me.
I have enough of the best blood in the world to feed 10 people.
But...
<Page13>
""I can't do that. I can never consume this soul."
Warmth for him. Blood to burn, to be preserved forever.
<Page14>
I don't mean to insult that man.
We already know he's an unrecognizable exception.
I have a feeling that the moment that thing approaches me will be the end of me.
Still, there are some things I cannot compromise.
<Page15>
""---Shatter!""
Then I'll read his movements and strike the long spear with 50% of my remaining strength.
<Page16>
A huge wave of debris collides and disperses.
That's not enough. The only thing he has pierced now is his own front.
This is just a blow to ensure your own safety. The enemy can't possibly be hit by such a blow.
It will come. It will come no matter what the cost.
<Page17>
""But...""
Sadly, that's the limit of humanity.
I cannot pass through the rain of debris on my own.
I can't even use the support of the Princess of the True Ancestors to my advantage.
<Page18>
If this downpour stops, it's over.
As long as they can see us, they will never allow such a surprise attack again...
<Page19>
""------""
My eyes widen as I see a thousand miles ahead.
---No. There's not a trace of him.
<Page20>
Not even a shadow of him running away.
A blow from a spear and he's dead. No way. That's just not true for that enemy, he chided himself.
If anything, a stronger chill of death is running down my spine.
<Page21>
For just a second, his thoughts drifted away from "the enemy".
It's obvious they're coming closer.
If you can't spot them, you're making a mistake.
He read that this sediment would be used as a shield.
But if it's not a shield...
<Page22>
""------ road, huh!""
I looked up to the sky. My enemy is against the moonlight.
There lies the mystic eyes of death perception, blue as a ghost.
<Page23>
The debris that swallowed Vlov wasn't the only thing Arcueid sent flying.
The real deal is this rock.
Out of the vampire's sight, in the shadows, she tied me up and blew me away.
<Page24>
Thirty meters below the surface, a tsunami of earth and sand crashed through.
Him and me. The final void between us.
I reaffirm my choice, and its consequences.
<Page25>
Tohno Shiki will lose both his legs.
Even if I survive this, I won't be able to walk for the rest of his life.
Imagine that life clearly.
---I don't care. For the price of these two seconds, it's a satisfying ending.
<Page26>
Only one second of searching.
I respect your insight, but one second is too late.
<Page27>
"Huh? But doesn't that mean that I will fall in the middle?
I can't control that, can I?
Of course I'm going to fall! So...
<Page28>
"You'll have to make a way for me."
<Page29>
The soaring bedrock comes together like a puzzle.
Ivy-tied, fixed, hastily constructed glide paths.
Aside from the difference in height, he and I are now at the same coordinates.
<Page30>
"Come on."
Measure the average survival rate.
Before we start, let's determine its <1|><point|>.
The route is set.
Only two seconds, 30 meters of one-way traffic.
"Showtime, vampires."
<Page31>
The glide fall begins.
A near-death, one-breath slider.
<Page32>
At this point, I've abandoned my response.
With my thinking speed, I can only make one decision per second.
In the two seconds before the fall, I focus all my abilities on two points only.
<Page33>
In this choice, every action faces death.
This is the point where the concentration of death is particularly high,
Assume a <moment|point> that cannot be survived no matter what you do.
<Page34>
I have decided on two minus points.
The survival rate outside of that is probably about 10%. We don't take that into account. If it's ten percent, it's fine.
<Page35>
The problem is the zero point.
It is the point of absolute death, where no matter what the human performance is, there is no choice but to die.
Put all your ability into it and raise zero to 1%.
<Page36>
In order to step over these two lines of death, I harden my consciousness.
There is no consciousness to allocate to other events.
So, now that I've started to descend, I don't have the ability to think about what to do.
<Page37>
What if the negative doesn't stay in two places?
That is not considered. I don't have the capacity to go beyond three deaths. Then he wins. It's just that his anomaly exceeds my imagination.
<Page38>
The ice spear folds up and rushes at the falling prey.
Like the jaws of a beast. It's terrifying, but it doesn't matter.
I don't care if it's just instinct.
The intercept that I knew would come and that I feared would get me killed..,
<Page39>
---10 meters.
The first Lethal attack.
The sensations in his limbs, the fine tuning of his muscle power, the sudden braking of his trunk and its return.
You can't change the trajectory of the fall, but you can change the angle of the fall after you "see" the angle of fire. ......!
<Page40>
A lump of iron passing right next to you.
The zero percent gamble has been exceeded.
One second left. I've won. He's out of options.
<Page41>
I've decided the second negative is 'that moment'.
I'll deal with the impact of this fall and kill him before my body shatters.
I don't know what happens after that. I'll just focus on piercing his line.
<Page42>
So.
If he makes one more move than I predict...
<Page43>
"------"
No idea. No need to duck. Even if I could change the point in the middle, I don't have that luxury.
That's why I gave up thinking.
If I was going to die, I would have died when I started running.
Good.
You could skewer my brain here and I wouldn't even notice.
<Page44>
---Secondly.
The emergency law of minus 100 degrees Celsius stops your whole body.
The instinct to prepare for landing,
The instinct to prepare for landing and the reason to advocate the meaning of life have been left far above.
<Page45>
"Vroove......!"
I transfer the kinetic energy from my thigh to my waist, from my waist to my back muscles, from my back muscles to the swing of my right hand holding the knife.
It no longer stops even if the muscles stop.
In other words, it is a killing machine that works only by sensitivity. All you need is a brain that can "catch" the line.
<Page46>
At that limit, I saw light.
The whirling will of atoms. A fixed life span of matter.
A pit-like point of death.
<Page47>
The brain, devoid of thought, understands by instinct.
If you say the line is the death of life, then that is the death of the origin of existence.
Killing any immortal, any monster with a single stab is nothing short of the most horrible thing in the world, the end of the universe.
<Page48>
But I really don't care about such a discovery.
My whole body shakes with a stronger emotion than that.
<Page49>
In Vlov's hand was a machete. Even after unleashing his deadly giant spear, this vampire was convinced that I was coming and chose to intercept further?
At this stage. Against a foul opponent like me.
<Page50>
"------"
This guy's real. I don't know your standards as a vampire. I'm not interested in that. He's simply a killer par excellence.
<Page51>
I can't help but hate him.
In his right mind, if he were not a vampire, he would have been a knight to be envied.
Even if he's a shadow of his former self now.
<Page52>
That weapon will never have a chance to reach me again.
Turn, duck, twist.
My eyes lined up the middle of him.
<Page53>
The temperature instantly switches to its original temperature.
The cold wave, far from a natural phenomenon, disappears with his life.
In it..,
"---what the hell is this?"
the vampire's monologue.
<Page54>
""...... I do not know this wound. I can't remember this loss.
This...unspoken touch of the air is something I lost sometime ago."
<Page55>
I don't know what you're talking about,
I don't even know what he's saying or where he's speaking from.
but his gentle voice is like that of a poet who is singing about spring.
<Page56>
"Ah---I feel no pain, no cold wave.
I'm afraid, but I miss it.
It's as if I've become a dead man."
