<Page1>
I stoop down in front of Arcueid.
I put my hands and knees on the earth.
<Page2>
An invisible arm runs through the ground.
Arcueid transforms the terrain into fine rubble like before―――no, the scale this time is much greater.//ruby dots <こ|・><の|・><地|・><形|・><を|・><変|・><動|・><さ|・><せ|・><た|・>//flag
<Page3>
The earth itself erupted. You'd be forgiven for thinking a bomb had gone off.//それは爆発を思わせる、大地そのものの隆起だった。
The power of an overwhelming number of fragments. If Vlov's cold air is like a blizzard, then what Arcueid did is like an earth tsunami.//木っ端微塵の力技
<Page4>
A flying ice spear is nothing more than a flung droplet of water before this wall-like agglomeration of earth and sand.//飛翔する 氷の 槍など、この 壁 の如き 土砂の 前では 飛沫に すぎない。
The mass, 50 meters tall and weighing 7000 tons, bears down on Vlov as if to swallow him whole.//高さ50メートル、7000トンに相当する質量が、ヴローヴを飲み込まんと押し寄せる。
<Page5>
And yet, the knight doesn't budge, even in the face of this natural disaster that turns the earth's surface inside out.
The billow of earth is driven back by a single thrust from his steel lance.
<Page6>
Vlov must have seen through the downpour of debris.
He must have seen Arcueid fall to her knees after using the last of her strength to upend that bedrock, and concluded that the 'threat' supposedly lurking behind this smokescreen was nowhere to be found.//最後の力で岩盤を両手でひっくり返し、その消耗から膝をついたアルクェイドと、おそらく、この土砂を目くらましにして接近する“脅威”が、どこにも見当たらない事を。
<Page7>
In the face of the towering wave, the man managed to regain his lapsed sense of reason.//<聳|そび>える大波を前にして、ソレは、かつての思考を取り戻した。
No, he regained it two minutes ago to be exact.//Reified verb from above いや、正確には２分前から。
His mind, which should have lost all sanity from the constant barrage of cold, has been trying to function normally ever since the moment he jumped away from the human closing in before him.
<Page8>
@gThat human has a way to kill me.//あの人間には自分を殺す用意がある
@gI don't know how, but I'm certain of it.//理屈は不明だが、それは間違いない
Vestiges of the time when he was normal.
His battle experience as a knight, forged in the Dark Ages of antiquity, has routed the curse that bound him hand and foot.//中世の暗黒時代に培った騎士としての闘争経験が、全身に巡る呪いを打ち払った。
The pride and dignity of a mere 20 years, triumphant over the madness that transcends thousands.//たった二十年程度の矜持が、千年を超える狂気に勝ったのだ。
<Page9>
He knows well the kind of miracle this is.
Moments like this come and go. Nothing more than a trick of the imagination before killing that human. A dream of an afterlife that will never come.
Never indulge yourself during combat―――Such human-like joy will freeze over in a matter of seconds.
<Page10>
"――――――Ha."
That is why he cannot help but be inflamed by this turn of events.
The enemy's aim is clear.
They will approach using the wall of debris as a shield.//Cannot come up with a good direct tl for 土砂. Earth works, but 'using the earth' as a shield directly makes one imagine them hugging the ground, so feel like a reification of wall here is also needed.  この土砂を盾にしてあの敵は接近してくる。
Their weapon is cutting. Even this wall is like a door to them. They will surely cut it and intrude into this space.
<Page11>
The lance is readied.
He knows that by all rights he ought to crush this wave along with the enemies concealed behind it.//本来ならこの大波ごと、その後ろに身を隠す敵を砕くべきだと理解している。
<Page12>
There is no need to respond to the enemy's tactics.
His strategy is to crush it all.
There is still plenty of power left in him.
The man has ten people's worth of the finest blood in stock.
However―――
<Page13>
"That I cannot do. No matter what, these souls are the only ones I can never consume."
They are his warmth. This blood, the fuel for his fire, he will preserve for all eternity.//I think the reading on this is that _even though_ blood is what fuels him, he will not burn this blood (I assume in the lore because it's from his mistresses or whatever?). 彼にとっての暖。燃え上がる為の血液を、永遠に温存する。
<Page14>
He didn't mean to look down on the human.
That thing was an exception evading description. He already understood that.
The man had a feeling the second that thing got close, it would all be over for him.
But even so, there are some things he cannot compromise on.
<Page15>
"―――Shatter―――!"
Thinking that it might be too late, he throws half of his remaining strength into his lance.//Assuming yomu is more predict/guess than read here? それでは手ぬるいと読みながら、長槍に残された力の五割をたたきこむ。ruby dots <手|・><ぬ|・><る|・><い|・>
<Page16>
The huge wave of debris collides and scatters.
It was not enough. The only thing pierced was the object in front of him.
That was just a blow to ensure his own safety. The enemy could not possibly be hit by such an attack.
He will definitely come. He will appear no matter the cost.
<Page17>
"But―――"
As sad as it is, that is the limit of humanity.
A human cannot pass through a rain of debris on his own.
He cannot even make use of support from the Princess of the True Ancestors to that end.
<Page18>
It will all be over when the downpour comes to an end.
As long as he can see the man's figure, he will never allow such a surprise attack aga―――
<Page19>
"――――――"
The man's eyes widen as the vast expanse in front of him comes into view.
―――Nothing. There isn't a single trace of him anywhere.
<Page20>
Not even his shadow running away.
Perhaps he died from the blow of the lance? Impossible. The man scolds himself for raising such a foolish question.
A chill of death runs down the man's spine, stronger than anything before.
<Page21>
For a mere second, the man's thoughts had drifted away from the 'enemy'.
It is obvious that they are drawing near.
If the enemy cannot be located, then there must be some mistake in his assumptions.
He predicted that the wall of debris would be used as a shield.//土砂 -> wall of debris この土砂は盾として使われると彼は読んだ。
However, if it wasn't used as a shield―――
<Page22>
"――――――Then it must be a road!"
The man looks up to the sky. To the enemy's figure outlined by moonlight.
And there, burning blue like a will-o'-the-wisp, the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.//Localize 亡霊のように青く灯る to wisps, which are I believe canonically blue
<Page23>
The debris that consumed Vlov wasn't the only thing that Arcueid sent flying.
This bedrock was the true objective.
She tied me down and blasted me out of his field of view, to a place unaffected by his cryogenic influence.//　吸血鬼の視界から外れ、<超|・><低|・><温|・><の|・><影|・><響|・><を|・><受|・><け|・><な|・><い|・><ヤ|・><ツ|・><の|・><頭|・><上|・><に|・>、俺を縛り付けてふっ飛ばしたのだ。
<Page24>
On the ground, 30 meters below, the tsunami of earth and sand is crushed.//30メートル下の地上で、土砂の津波が突き砕かれる。
Me and him. The final empty space between us.
I reaffirm my choices, along with their consequences.
<Page25>
If this is successful, I, Tohno Shiki, will lose both of my legs.
Even if I were to survive, I wouldn't be able to walk again for the rest of my life.
I imagine that sort of future in great detail.
―――I don't mind. In exchange for these two seconds, it's a price I'll happily pay.
<Page26>
A mere second to locate the enemy.
I have to respect his perceptiveness, but with that second it's already too late.
<Page27>
"Huh? But wouldn't that mean you'll fall down halfway?//This page a ref to 05_00_ARC05_9_2.txt:L36-8
I can't really do anything about that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page28>
"―――I need you to create a path for me."
<Page29>
The soaring bedrock is assembled like a puzzle.
A hastily constructed runway lashed together by ivy.
Aside from the difference in altitude, both of us now exist at the same coordinates in space.//I.e, he is directly above him 高さの差を除けば、俺とヤツはいま、同じ座標に存在している。
<Page30>
"―――Now then."
I estimate the average chance of survival.
Before I begin, I give it 1% odds.//始める前に、その一点を確定させる。ruby dots <一|・><点|・>
The route is set.
A one-way road spanning 30 meters in a mere two seconds.
"It's showtime, vampire."
<Page31>
The gliding descent begins.
A short slide toward death itself.
<Page32>
I've completely given up on responding to him at this point.//この時点で、俺は対応を放棄している。
I can only make one decision per second with my current speed of thought.
Within the two seconds before I fall, I focus all my abilities on only two points.
<Page33>
The decision I made will bring me face to face with death at every turn.//この選択において、あらゆる行動が死に面している。
But even amongst those brushes with death, there exist moments that push even more perilously close than others.//その中でも特に死の濃度の高い地点、
Cases where you may not be able to survive no matter what you do.//何をしても生き残れない<瞬間|ポイント>を想定する。
<Page34>
I've identified two such critical moments.//マイナス地点は二ヵ所と決めた。
Excluding those, the survival rate is probably around 10%. I can work with those odds - I'll ignore the favorable cases for now.
<Page35>
The problem is those cases with a 0% chance of success.//問題なのはゼロの地点だ。
Against those odds, no matter your abilities as a human, your death is a foregone conclusion.//人間の性能ではどうあっても死ぬしかない絶対死の地点。
So I'll give it everything I've got, and drag that 0% chance up to 1%.//そこに全能力を注ぎ込み、ゼロを１％に引き上げる。
<Page36>
In order to overcome those two fatal scenarios, I steel myself.
I have no mental capacity left to allocate to any other eventualities.
So now that I've started to descend, I don't have the ability to think about how to respond to him.//俺には対応を考える機能はない。
<Page37>
What if there are more than just two of those do-or-die moments?//もしマイナスが二ヵ所に留まらない場合は？
I do not consider that. I don't have the capacity to overcome three 'deaths' in my mind. If that's how it plays out, victory is his. It would just mean that his power is stronger than I can imagine.
<Page38>
A dense flurry of ice spears shoot toward the falling prey.//氷の槍は折り重なるように、落下する獲物に殺到する。
It's like the jaws of a beast. It's terrifying, but it doesn't matter.
I wonder if it's thanks to his instincts that he anticipated this.//そんな、ただ本能に因っただけの咀嚼など知った事か。
Convinced that I would come for him, and terrified that I would kill him when I did...//俺がそうくると確信し、そうなれば殺されると恐れた迎撃は、
<Page39>
―――Ten meters.
The first chance for failure.
The sensations of my limbs, the fine-tuning of my muscles, and the sudden braking of my torso return.//Sudden braking weird but I guess accurate? 手足の 感覚、筋力の 微調整、体幹の 急制動とその返し。
After witnessing that angle of fire, I alter the natural course of my trajectory...!//本来変えられない落下軌道を、その射角を『見て』から変える……！
<Page40>
A lump of iron passes right next to me.
My gamble on that '0%' chance paid off.
One second left. Victory is mine. He is already out of options.
<Page41>
I've decided the second critical juncture is 'that moment'.//二つ目のマイナスは『その瞬間』と決めている。
I'll parry the impact of this fall, and before my body shatters, I'll kill him.//Shatter is as a result of Vlov's cold この落下の衝撃をいなし、俺の身体が粉々になる前に、ヤツを殺す。
I don't know what will happen after that. I'll just focus my undivided attention on cutting his 'lines'.
<Page42>
That's why.
If he makes one more move than I predict...
<Page43>
"――――――"
I won't think. I won't even dodge. Even if I could change the situation halfway through, I wouldn't bother with something so pointless.//たとえ最中にポイントを変更できるとしても、そんな無駄は俺にはない。
That's why I gave up thinking.
If I'm going to die, then I was dead from the moment I started gliding.//死ぬというのなら滑走を始めた時に死んでいる。
This is fine.
I'm sure that if he skewered my brain here, I wouldn't notice it at all.
<Page44>
―――The second chance for failure.
The extreme -100℃ conditions bring my entire body to a halt.
My instinct to prepare for landing,
and the reasoning necessary to advocate for the significance of life have already been left behind with the night sky.
<Page45>
"Vlov...!"
I transfer the kinetic energy from my thighs to my waist, from my waist to my back muscles, and from my back muscles to the swing of the knife in my right hand.
My muscles no longer try to hold me back.//もはや筋肉が停止しようと止まらない。
I am a killing machine that works on raw sensory input alone. The only thing I need to focus on is capturing the lines.//Capturing? つまり感性だけで動く殺人機巧。振り絞るものは、線を<捉|とら>える脳だけでいい。
<Page46>
I see a light around the periphery of his locus.//We previously translated 極点 as locus, so I guess 極限 should be the periphery of said locus? その極限で、光を視た。
The whirling will of atoms. The predetermined lifespan of matter.
The pit-like point of death.
<Page47>
Having abandoned all thought, I understand through instinct.//思考を棄てた脳が、本能で理解する。
If lines represent the death of life, then that 'point' represents the death of existence.
Any immortal being, any monster, could be 'killed' by a single strike. It is none other than the end of the universe, the most repulsive thing in the world.//どのような不死身、どのような怪物であれ一刺しで“殺す”、この世でもっともおぞましい、宇宙の終わりに他ならない。
<Page48>
But I really don't care about that discovery.
My whole body shakes with a feeling far stronger than that.
<Page49>
A machete is grasped in Vlov's hand. Even after unleashing his giant, deadly lance, this vampire was convinced that I was coming and chose to intercept me.
At this stage. Against an opponent like me who fights dirty.//反則 is foul play, not that Shiki smells bad この局面で。俺のような反則相手に。
<Page50>
"――――――"
This guy is the real deal. I don't know how he stacks up as a vampire. I don't care to know. But as a murderer, he is extraordinary.//コイツは本物だ。吸血鬼としての基準は知らない。そんなものは興味がない。シンプルに人殺しとして卓越している。
<Page51>
I can't help but hate him.
If he was in his right mind and wasn't a vampire, he would've been a knight to be envied.
Even if I can see no shadow of that past self now.//たとえ、今は見る影すらないとしても。
<Page52>
That weapon will never have a chance to reach me.
Turning, dodging, and twisting.
My eyes spot a line along his center.
<Page53>
In an instant, the atmosphere reverts back to its original temperature.
The cold wave that was far removed from any natural phenomenon disappears along with the man's life.
In the middle of it all,
"―――What, is this?"
The vampire monologues as he sways.
<Page54>
"...I do not know this wound. I cannot remember this loss.//この傷は知らない。この喪失は思い出せない
This―――indescribable feeling of the air on my skin, is something I lost some time ago."
<Page55>
I don't know what he's talking about,
or which country's language he's speaking in.
But his gentle voice reminds me of a poet celebrating the spring.
<Page56>
"Ah―――I feel no pain, nor do I feel the cold waves.
It is terrifying but familiar.
Almost as though I had become a dead man."
