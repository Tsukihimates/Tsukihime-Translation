It's by sliding.
No, the correct term is closer to falling.
...... But can I do it? It would be up to fate whether I can make it there.
<Page2>
There's no way that it will end up being safe. Even if everything goes well, the impact of the landing will tear my muscles and break my bones.
Will I really be able to endure that pain?
<Page3>
I stop the projectiles in time like I was stabbing my worries away.
That was close. Thank god.
Because of that, I can finally make my decision.
I just need to bear the burden. From the beginning, I was always insensitive when it comes to death.
Just like the way he is, I'll also only consider how to kill him without a second to spare.
<Page4>
I turn around and run to Arcueid in the rear.
My energy is completely exhausted from the excess movement.
I can't take even one more step forward.
The enemy I must approach is 50 meters away on the other side.
<Page5>
It doesn't matter.
In any case, the horizontal distance has no bearing on my choice.
<Page6>
"Arcueid, can you do that thing again from earlier!?"
"What do you mean by 'that thing'!?"
<Page7>
I tell Arcueid about my intention.
The explanation ends with a single word.
After a moment of bewilderment, Arcueid looks at me and agrees as if she had no choice.
<Page8>
"...... If we do it on that scale, I'll run out of energy to spare.
But you're okay with that, right? You won't be able to run anymore."
<Page9>
I nod without a care.
I don't have the strength to speak up. Or rather, has she been looking for an opportunity this entire time!?
<Page10>
"Huh? But wouldn't that mean you'll fall down halfway?
I can't really do anything about that."
"Of course I'm going to fall! That's why―――"
<Page11>
Even though I wanted to fix my breathing a little, I ended up lecturing her in a loud voice.
And over there,
<Page12>
"―――!"
There's no time to explain.
The spears of ice sweeps towards me. Vlov plans to pierce Arcueid through me without mercy.
<Page13>
"It's fine, so do it with all your strength and don't hold back! I don't care if you overdo it! If I get killed as a result, then that's just what you wanted from the start!"
<Page14>
There's no time for pretense.
I take my gaze off Arcueid and stare at the enemy on the other side.
As if she was responding to my order, the woman from behind me says,
<Page15>
"Yeah, leave it to me! I'll make sure that you win, Shiki!"
