"I'm exhausted."
I roll over onto my back.
My heart and lungs scream with joy.
My breathing, which has been stopped for so long, finally resumed like a human being.
<Page2>
My hands can no longer move.
I'm not even sure if I'm holding the knife.
The only thing I can be sure of is the pain all over my body and my consciousness that seems to fall into darkness as I relax at this very moment.
<Page3>
...... I really am lucky. My sense of pain has been numbed thanks to that.
The pain in my left foot that I broke while gliding mid-air would have been unbearable under normal circumstances. It's as if every bone in my body is being sawed away. I can hardly feel the pain that sparks from my eyes even now.
<Page4>
"But――― shit."
I didn't want to, but I couldn't help but let the swear come out of my mouth.
<Page5>
...... There was nothing like that of a lingering memory.
Nor was there any pride of accomplishing such a feat.
This was nothing like a miracle. It was just me slapping my emotions together after everything that had happened.
<Page6>
"――――― A moon."
There is a waning moon in the night sky.
...... I wonder why.
It's terribly nostalgic. I feel like I saw something similar in my dream at least once.
<Page7>
"Are you okay, Shiki?"
<Page8>
Arcueid walks up to me as if nothing had happened.
<Page9>
"....... Well, I'm alive, at least."
The truth is that I feel like I'm dying so much that it's painful just to speak.
But I cannot allow myself to make such feeble complaints as someone who managed to make it out alive.
<Page10>
"Geez, you really didn't need to be so humble.
Even as a newbie, you killed a member of the Ancestors, you know?
You should be more proud of yourself."
<Page11>
Arcueid looks as happy as she can be.
...... In fact, there must have been value in killing Vlov. Even I know that much.
But even so―――
<Page12>
...... There was nothing I could do.
How far did that glacier encroach the city? At the very least, the carnage was even worse than at the hotel, and now I must look away again―――
"? They're not dead.
If it's Vlov's curse you're worried about, I've got it all covered."
――― Or so I thought.
<Page13>
"W-what do you mean by that, ow......!!"
As soon as I strain to sit up, I feel a sharp pain in my left leg that sends me sprawling.
<Page14>
"Come on now, you need to lie down."
"Agh......! B-besides that, I need you...... to explain everything.
Are they really not dead......?"
<Page15>
"Yeah. When the Principle of the Vlov went out of control, I coated what I could with a convection membrane.
If you had killed Vlov even a little bit later, I wouldn't have been able to follow up."
<Page16>
Arcueid readily confesses her outrageous offense.
...... Speaking of which, that time.
She made a strange, sudden stop before being hit by Vlov's lance.
Was that not to protect herself, but to protect the city......?
<Page17>
...... Yeah, that's right. If you think about it, it's strange that I'm still alive even after that cold wave had spread.
Just as I was able to breathe in those super cold temperatures, the people of the city must also have been safe.
That's why―――
<Page18>
That's why she was in such a mess.
While I was only thinking of myself, she protected the entire city knowing that she would be at a disadvantage―――
<Page19>
"W――― Why would you do something that!?
Didn't you say that you didn't care about humans!?"
In a fit of unknown rage, I thoughtlessly yell at the person before me.
Arcueid curiously raises and lowers her eyebrows, and then...
<Page20>
"Well that's because it was what you wanted."
She says something as stupid as that.
<Page21>
"――――――"
...... Did I, say that?
When? Where? Maybe it was...
<Page22>
"But you're kind of different. After all, you've never even drank blood before.
In that case, it's fine. Whether you're a vampire or whatever else, if you don't lay a hand on anyone then it's okay."
<Page23>
――― I don't believe this.
'If you don't lay a hand on anyone then it's okay'
She did it because of that?
Even when she could have been destroyed with one wrong move?
<Page24>
"Ha......"
I laugh at the fact.
I am now more stunned than ever.
I'm stunned, but more than that, I am more grateful than I ever was.
<Page25>
...... I close my eyelids.
With this, I think I can go to sleep now.
My chest that was filled with nothing but regret is now covered in relief.
My consciousness fades away.
I forget the pain in my legs and fall into a deep sleep.
...... And then.
<Page26>
I'm forcibly snapped back to reality by Arcueid's strike on my head.
"...... What are you, trying to pull?"
<Page27>
"You can't. If you fall asleep with such a wound, it will be more painful when you wake up right? I'll close the wound if you're going to sleep. That way is more efficient."
<Page28>
――― That is a perfectly valid argument.
I wonder who it was that said that exact same thing to her?
<Page29>
"...... Arcueid. Can I give you some serious advice?"
"Hmm, what is it?"
"You know. You should stop saying such absurd things, you stupid woman."
<Page30>
That's my limit.
With that, I've really used up all my energy.
<Page31>
My consciousness fades.
Arueid is making some noise about something, but I don't have the strength to open my eyes anymore.
<Page32>
"Ah...... Hold on Shiki, are you really going to fall asleep......?"
...... I told you that I was sleepy.
I'll sleep before I die, so please wake me up when it's morning..
<Page33>
"Are you really going to? That's definitely going to hurt. Do you really not need any healing? I'm sure you'll faint when you wake up."
――― Oh shut up.
I'm going to sleep, so if you want to do something then do it.
<Page34>
"Yeah, if that's the case then you should've told me that earlier."
After hearing a cheerful voice.
I feel the cold fingertips, colder than my body, touch my skin in a caring manner.
A feeling of joy rises from my face more than my drowsiness from the pleasant sensation.
<Page35>
"Spoils of war? Or rather, the Ancestor's remains?
Well, whatever! I was just wondering where I should throw it away!"
...... Slime?
<Page36>
"W-w-what, what was that feeling? Did you just apply something just now!?
Ooh, ow, oww, the pain is coming back!?
It hurts a lot, no, it's itchy, or rather, it's scary!
What the hell are you―――"
<Page37>
Right as I was about to ask what she was doing, I was attacked by a tremendous feeling of emptiness.
<Page38>
Was that shouting just now the last remaining heat in my body?
This time, my consciousness goes into a deep sleep without fighting back.
<Page39>
"It's okay, this stuff isn't bad. I can cover it up if I just use the split off flesh.
But I can't do much about the bones. You should definitely see a doctor afterwards."
The cold fingertips move away.
<Page40>
"Are you asleep, Shiki―――?"
――― Yeah, I really am asleep.
It's been a while since I've had such a deep sleep――― a sleep that wasn't so dreadful.
<Page41>
"It can't be helped. Your house is the mansion on top of that hill right?
I'll find a way to bring you home somehow."
――― I simply gaze exclusively at the white moon as I sleep.
<Page42>
"...... You've done well, Shiki. And thank you.
I was saved tonight thanks to you."
<Page43>
Words of gratitude that didn't seem to carry any weight in the slightest.
I can't hear her voice any longer.
My consciousness falls into a deep slumber, this time without being disturbed by anyone.
