"Okay, let's take a quick break.
You must be hungry, right Shiki? Do you want seconds of what I made earlier? Or shall I make you something new?"
<Page2>
"―――#No, I'll handle it.
I'll just help myself to the ingredients in the fridge."
<Page3>
I don't usually judge a dish at first glance, but I didn't have the guts to eat something that only used the flavor of raw ingredients like that.
For a moment, I thought I could do it if I was in perfect condition... but no, even then it would be impossible.
Although the danger of Vlov cannot be avoided, I can avoid this danger at least.
<Page4>
After finishing a light meal, I resume my conversation with Arcueid.
The question of what we're going to do is settled. All that remains is to work out how to do it.
The problem is those flames.# Until we do something about them, neither I nor Arcueid can get close to him.
<Page5>
"...I guess a surprise attack is our only option.
It did seem like you were his target. We should have you act as a decoy and lure him out.
Meanwhile, I'll hide in advance and attack him from behind during the window when he's fixated on you... or something like that."
<Page6>
It's a pretty rough plan, but it's the only one I can think of right now.
The only remaining question is how I'm going to get close to him with those flames in the way...
<Page7>
"Yeah. I think a plan like that should work.
I'll be the decoy, and you'll be the attacker. If it's you, then the question of how much energy Vlov has in reserve becomes irrelevant."
<Page8>
"...There are still other problems though.
Leaving me aside, you're the one that has to fight that guy head-on. What are you going to do about those hand-like flames?"
<Page9>
"Hm? That shouldn't be a problem.
After taking that hit, I figured that Vlov's flame was somewhere around 3000℃. So I'll be able to endure if I rebuild my body to become heat resistant from now on."
<Page10>
"Huh...?"
No, isn't it weird to say a number like 3000℃ so casually?
Wouldn't that kind of temperature be enough to melt even a rock?
<Page11>
"The surrounding flames are much easier to handle.
Those only cover the surface, so when you come out of the shadows, I'll let out a little shout and blow them away.
Although I couldn't do it back in the hotel since you were behind me."
<Page12>
...A shout, huh.
It feels a little too easy, but the fact is that she already saved my life once.
<Page13>
"Yup, that pretty much settles it.
First, I'll become the bait and lure out Vlov. Meanwhile, you'll find somewhere to hide.
Then, when Vlov appears, we'll fight for a little bit.
I won't be able to defeat Vlov with my strength tonight, but I can at least put out the flames around him and hinder his movement."
<Page14>
"What do you mean 'hinder his movement'? Don't tell me that you're going to grab him and pin him down from above... are you?"
<Page15>
"I'm not going to do anything that uncivilized.
It would be futile to hold him down directly. Besides, I've never done it before, and I don't feel like starting now."
<Page16>
"I-I see. In that case, how are you going to subdue him?"
"It depends on the location, but essentially I'll be using chains."
<Page17>
"Chains...? You mean, just ordinary chains?"
"Yeah. You know, something like this."
"!?"#W-What's this, my hands are bound by chains all of a sudden...!?//Glue forces linebreak
Wait, where did these chains even come from!?
<Page18>
"They're formed by immobilizing the elements in the air. I find this shape easy to visualize.# As for how strong they are... at the moment, each chain could probably hold about a hundred tons? I'll pile a couple dozen of these on him, which should cut off his movement at the very least."
<Page19>
"I'll mainly restrain his limbs and leave some space on his head and torso, so that's where you should aim when you go to cut one of his lines of death."
<Page20>
"...O-Okay, I get it I get it, so please untie me, I can feel my hands ripping off, they'll get torn off, before I even face Vlov!"
<Page21>
The chains that had suddenly appeared become thinner and vanish like they were melting into the air itself.
...Once again, I am forced to contend with the sheer ludicrousness of Arcueid's existence.
<Page22>
But it's true that if she can create those 'chains' at will, we should be able to restrain Vlov for a short period of time.
<Page23>
"...Well, anyway!
I'll bind Vlov's limbs with those chains if I see an opening during our fight.
I can only fully restrain him for around ten seconds, so when I do you'll have to burst out with a swift, head-on attack on his shortest line.
Don't worry. With skill like yours, he'll be dead in no time."
<Page24>
"......What do you mean 'head-on'......"
Arcueid says it like there was nothing wrong, but I still end up feeling worried.
<Page25>
"No, let's not make any assumptions about things we have no experience with.
On second thought, I'll find some way to get close from behind and cut the 'lines' on his limbs. If I do that, I can restrict his movements for the time being―――"
<Page26>
Then there is no need for Arcueid to 'fight' him.
The choice to fight can be made only if my surprise attack fails.
With that in mind, I look at Arcueid's face―――
<Page27>
"―――Shiki. In that case, you would die."
"Eh―――?"
<Page28>
"This is not a matter of how to do things safely.
We're not talking about how to avoid death, we're talking about how to kill."
<Page29>
"Well that's―――true I guess."
"You're going up against a vampire from now on.
That's why you must throw away your sense of morality, even if it's just for tonight. Carrying around that burden will only weigh you down when the time comes."
<Page30>
"...I know that much. Our opponent is a monster after all, which is why I'm willing to help."
<Page31>
"No, you don't understand at all, Shiki.
Cutting off a limb? You should give up on such a suicidal act. If you have time to cut off his limbs, you should use that time to sever his life instead. It would be different if he were any other creature, but as it is this is something only you can do.
Do you get it? Don't give Vlov a chance to fight back. The only advantage you have is that he doesn't know about your ability."
<Page32>
The look in Arcueid's eyes leaves no room for argument.
...Her red eyes assert that fact.
'If you miss your first shot, there won't be another chance.'
<Page33>
...She's right.
It's just like she said. While I leisurely waste my time cutting off his limbs, my body would be burned to a crisp―――
<Page34>
"Vlov will show himself when night falls.
When that time comes, we―――no, you and I must both go in with the intent to utterly pulverize.
It's not about how to survive.
It's about how to kill. Nothing more."
<Page35>
Arcueid gazes straight at me with her deadly eyes.
...She is really angry.
She's angry at the fact that I still harbor such naive thoughts.
<Page36>
"―――Fine. I won't hesitate.
I'll cut all of his lines in one go.
That should be fine, right, Arcueid?"
<Page37>
"........."
Arcueid's gaze remains stern.
...The fact that she doesn't reply suggests that she's at least satisfied with my answer.
<Page38>
"But where should I wait for him?
This apartment is no different than the hotel. If there is some place with very few people where I can hide..."
<Page39>
"The park at the center of the city is our best bet. It's deserted at night after all.# ―――But if there do happen to be people passing by, it would be purely their own bad luck."
<Page40>
Arcueid turns her back and averts her gaze.
"...What. If you have something to say, then say it."
<Page41>
"You can't do it. After all, you never said the word 'kill' even once.
At this rate, you will hesitate at the very last moment. And then you'll be killed before you even know it."
<Page42>
"...As if that would happen. That guy is a monster that killed over a hundred people. There's no way that I would ever hesitate in killing him."
"―――――――"
Arcueid breathes a tiny sigh.
<Page43>
"...I could take Vlov down with certainty if I just enchanted you with my Mystic Eyes. I'm not sure why, but even though this is the first time I've thought about doing it, I just can't bring myself to go through with it.
It's like some sort of contradiction."
<Page44>
"I'll believe in you, Shiki. Let's defeat Vlov together."
Arcueid turns around, returning from a gloomy to cheerful tone.
<Page45>
...I wonder why.
Even though her eyes were filled with trust, I can't help but sense a terrible apprehension in her smile.
