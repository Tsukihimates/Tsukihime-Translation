"Well, let's take a short break.
You must be hungry, Shiki. Do you want some more of that? Shall I make you another meal?"
<Page2>
".......... #No, I'll make it myself.
I'll just use the ingredients in the fridge as I please."
<Page3>
I don't judge a dish at first glance, but I didn't have the guts to eat a dish like that that made use of just the flavor of the raw ingredients.
I thought for a moment that if I were in prime condition I could go on.....but I was wrong.
Although the danger of Vlov cannot be avoided, this danger can be avoided.
<Page4>
After a quick meal, I resume my conversation with Arcueid.
At any rate, we've decided on a course of action. All that remains is to formulate a strategy.
The problem is that fire. #As long as we don't do something about it, neither I nor Arcueid can get close to him.
<Page5>
"...... I guess we'll just have to take him by surprise.
He seemed to be after you. I'm going to ask you to take the bait and lure Vlov to me.
I'll hide in advance and attack him from behind while he's focused on you.......ok?"
<Page6>
It's a pretty rough idea, but it's the only one I can think of right now.
I still have to figure out how to get close to those flames, though.......
<Page7>
"Yes. I guess that's the basic idea.
I'm going to be the decoy, and you will be the attacker. If it's you, it doesn't matter how many life reserves Vlov has.
<Page8>
"...... There are other problems, too.
You've got to face him head on. What about that hand-like flame?"
<Page9>
"What? Does it matter?
I've been on the receiving end of it once and found out that Vlov's flames are only 3000℃. I'll be able to withstand it as long as I rebuild my body to be heat resistant from now on."
<Page10>
"Huh......?"
No, isn't it weird to say "only" 3000℃?
That's a temperature that could melt a rock, right?
<Page11>
"The surrounding flames are much easier to handle.
The thing is only mildly contaminated on the ground surface, so when Shiki comes out of the shadows, I'll blow it off with a little energy.
At the hotel, I couldn't do it because Shiki was behind me."
<Page12>
Blow it off, huh?
It's a very easy and appropriate nuance to use, but the fact is that it saved my life at that time.
<Page13>
"Yeah, that's pretty much it.
First, I'll be the bait to lure the Vlov. Shiki will hide in advance.
Then, when Vlov comes, we'll fight for a bit.
I can' t defeat Vlov with my strength tonight, but I can put out the flames around him and keep him at bay.
<Page14>
"What exactly do you mean by keeping him at bay.....?　Don't tell me you're going to grab him and put him down from above?"
<Page15>
"I'm not going to do anything that savage.
I've never done it before.I don't see the need for it."
<Page16>
"I see. So how do you keep the Vlov at bay?
"Depends on the location, but basically, chains."
<Page17>
"Chains ......?　Chains, you mean like the chains?"
"Yeah. Like this one."
"What?" #What the heck is this, my hands are suddenly bound with chains ......?
Before that, where did this chain come from?
<Page18>
"It's a physical form of the elements in the air. I like that shape because it's easy to visualize.#The strength is ...... hmm, I guess now it's up to about 100 tons per strand. Anyway, I'm going to put dozens of them on top of each other, so I can just seal off his movements.
<Page19>
"The chain restraints will be mainly on the limbs and less on the torso and head, so you can just cut the <line|death> on Vlov's torso."
<Page20>
"O..Ok..OK. I get it. So release me from these."
<Page21>
The chains that suddenly appeared thinned and disappeared as if they were melting into the air.
...... Once again, I realize the sheer ridiculousness of Arcueid.
<Page22>
But certainly, if we can get the chains in and out at will now, we can temporarily restrain Vlov.
<Page23>
"...... Well, anyway!
When the fight comes, I will take the opportunity to bind Vlov's hands and feet with the chains.
It would only take about ten seconds to completely block his movement, and then you would have to jump out of the shadows and cut off his line in the shortest possible time, straight from the front.
Don't worry. It's so easy to kill with your skills."
<Page24>
"......from the front?....seriously.....?"
Arcueid says don't worry, but I'm still worried.
<Page25>
"No, let's not make assumptions about things we haven't already done.
After all, maybe I can manage to get up behind him and cut the lines between his arms and legs. That way, I'll be able to take away his freedom for the time being..."
<Page26>
There is no need for Arcueid to "fight" him.
The choice to fight can be made only after my surprise attack has failed.
With that in mind, I looked at Arcueid's face---......
<Page27>
"Shiki. Then you are going to die."
"What?
<Page28>
"This is not about how to act safely.
It's not about how not to die, it's about how to kill."
<Page29>
"That's... that's true.
"You're going to be dealing with vampires.
Carrying that kind of baggage will only weigh you down when the time comes."
<Page30>
"...... I know that much. I'm just trying to help you because you're dealing with a monster."
<Page31>
"No, you don't understand, Shiki.
Cutting off a limb? Stop it, such a suicidal act. If you have time to cut off his limbs, cut off his life first. Only you can do that, not any other creature.
Is that clear? Don't give the Vlov a chance to fight back. The only advantage you have is that he doesn't know who you are."
<Page32>
Arcueid's eyes don't allow me to deny it.
.......The red eyes assert that.
"If you miss your first shot, you won't have another choice" they said.
<Page33>
...... Indeed.
She's right, my body will burn up while I'm taking the time to cut off the limbs first.
<Page34>
"Vlov will come at night.
When he does, we - no, you and I - are going to kill him in the only way we know how.
It's not about how to survive.
Just think about how you're going to kill him."
<Page35>
Arcueid looks straight at me with her deadly eyes.
......She's really angry.
I know that I, Shiki Tohno, am still somewhat naive in my thinking.
<Page36>
"All right. I won't hold back.
I'll cut all his lines in one breath.
Is that what you want, Arcueid?"
<Page37>
"..............."
Arcueid's gaze remains stern.
...... The fact that she didn't reply with anything suggests that she was at least satisfied with my answer.
<Page38>
"But where should I wait for him?
This mansion is no different than the hotel.If there is somewhere with very few crowd and a place to hide...
<Page39>
"The best place to go is the city's central park, as it's not crowded at midnight. #If someone were to pass by ......, it would be purely because they were out of luck."
<Page40>
Arcueid turned her back and averted her gaze from me.
"What is it........? If you have something to say, say it."
<Page41>
"I can't. After all, you never said "kill" even once.
If you continue like this, you'll probably hesitate at the last moment. And then you will be killed without a fight."
<Page42>
"...... There is no possibility of that. The person I am dealing with is a monster that has killed over a hundred people. There's no way I'm going to hesitate about killing him."
"-------"
Arcueid sighed softly.
<Page43>
".......If I could just enchant you with my mystic eye, I could certainly finish off Vlov. I'm not sure why, but for the first time I really want to, and for the first time I don't like doing so.
What a contradiction."
<Page44>
"I believe in you, Shiki. The two of us will defeat Vlov together."
Turning from the dark voice, Arcueid turns around in a cheerful tone.
<Page45>
......I wonder why.
It was a terribly anxious smile, even though her eyes were full of trust.
