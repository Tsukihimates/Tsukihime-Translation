"――――――"
If I'm being honest, I don't think we can let Vlov off the hook for even a second.
...But going after him now would be too reckless.
<Page2>
Us just going out looking for him and defeating him? That's not even worth considering.
That kind of thinking is just an irresponsible escape from reality to ease my own guilt.
<Page3>
...I need to collect myself.
I must do so if I really want to defeat that vampire.
I understand that if I truly want to reduce the number of casualties, I have no choice but to wait here.
<Page4>
But still―――three days is far too long.
<Page5>
"...Arcueid.
You said that my duty as a guard ended yesterday, right?"
<Page6>
"I did say that, but... what? Are you still scared after all?"
"No, that's not what I mean. If we're doing this as a team and not out of obligation, then I have a favor to ask of you.
I will do as you say. I'll follow your instructions. I may not be able to act as your shield, but I can at least become your knife.
That's why in return―――"
<Page7>
"In return?"
"―――I can't wait three days. Let's lure him out tonight."
<Page8>
"Um... are you being serious?"
Arcueid is taken aback by my suicidal remark.
I am fully aware of how dangerous it is. Even so, there is a line that I cannot cross.
<Page9>
"Do you think I can joke at a time like this?
I don't want to die either. So please listen to me. If you rest until tonight, could you defeat Vlov if you had the help of my eyes?"
<Page10>
Arcueid is the only one who can judge that.
That's why... if she decides that it's possible, then I will wager everything on that possibility.
<Page11>
"...I see. If you move exactly the way I tell you to, then I guess we'd have the upper hand.
But is that really okay? It would be much safer to just wait three days you know."
"...I know that. But this is as much as I can handle. I can't wait any longer." // dropping mentally intentionally here because its awkward in english.
<Page12>
"Hmm... well, in that case, it's fine.
And to be honest, there's only a small chance that we'll be able to avoid him for three days anyway."
<Page13>
"So now I guess this is a strategy meeting.
Where do you want to fight, Shiki?"
"Eh? Wait, but... is that really okay?"
<Page14>
I couldn't help but ask back.
I didn't think that Arcueid――someone who takes battle seriously――would listen to my request so readily.
<Page15>
"I told you, it's fine.//ruby dots <そ|・><れ|・>
Either we keep running for three days, or we find and kill Vlov tonight.
They both have the same chance of success either way. The only difference is your own chance of survival."
<Page16>
"...I see. Thank you, Arcueid."
"I wouldn't recommend it though.
You really are a mystery, Shiki."
<Page17>
I've increased my chances against Vlov.
It's only natural that Arcueid is taken back; she's someone who values efficiency and certainty.
But even so, Arcueid did not reject my idea.
<Page18>
I wonder if it is because she respects my feelings, or if it is because the odds wouldn't change either way.
Well, in any case, I'm grateful that she is able to understand.
