"------"
If I'm being honest, I don't think we can let Vlov off the hook for even a second.
......, but that's too reckless.
<Page2>
Now should we find and defeat him now? That's not a good idea.
This is just an irresponsible escape from reality to reduce the guilt I feel.
<Page3>
...... I need to calm down now.
If I really want to defeat that vampire.
If I truly want to reduce the number of casualties, I must understand that I have to endure here for now.
<Page4>
Still....three days is too long.
<Page5>
"...... Arcueid.
I thought you said my duty as a guard ended yesterday.”
<Page6>
"I did say that,but......are you're still scared?"
"No, that's not what I meant. If it's going to be cooperation from here on out, and not obligation, then I want you to do me a favour.
I will do as you say. I'll follow your instructions. I may not be able to act as your shield ......, but I can at least use the knife.
So, in return..."
<Page7>
"In return?"
"I can't wait three days. Let's lure him out tonight.
<Page8>
"Um,......are you serious?
Do you want to die?  Arcueid was taken aback.
I know it's dangerous. Even so, there is a line that cannot be compromised.
<Page9>
"I don't know if I can say this in jest.
I don't want to die either. So let me ask you. With you resting until tonight, and with my eyes, can you defeat Vlov?
<Page10>
Arcueid is the only one who can measure that.
So if ...... she decides she can, then I'll bet on that possibility.
<Page11>
"...... Yes. If you do what I say, we'll be stronger.
But is that what you want?　It's safer to wait three days.
"...... I know. I know, but this is the limit of my tolerance. My mind can't take much more than that.
<Page12>
"Hmm. ...... Well, that's good then.
And let's face it, there was little chance we'd get away with it for three days.”
<Page13>
"So, we're changing course now, let's have a strategy meeting.
Where do you want to fight, Shiki?”
"What?　No, is it really okay with you?
<Page14>
I couldn't help but ask back.
I didn't think that Arcueid, who gets so serious when it comes to battle, would listen to my request so easily.
<Page15>
"I told you that it would be fine.
Either I can keep running for three days, or we can kill Vlov tonight.
They both have the same success rate. The only difference is in your chance of survival."
<Page16>
"...... I see. Thank you, Arcueid.”
"I wouldn't recommend it, though.
I really don't know, Shiki.”
<Page17>
I've narrowed down my own chances of defeating Vlov.
It is  no wonder that Arcueid, who values efficiency and certainty, is dismayed.
Still, Arcueid did not say 'no'.
<Page18>
I wondered whether she respected my feelings or if it was because the odds were same both ways?
Well, either way, I'm glad that she understood.
