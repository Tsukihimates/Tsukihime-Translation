"------"
If I'm being honest, I don't think we can let Vlov off the hook for even a second.
......, but that's too reckless.
<Page2>
Now are we going to find and defeat him now?　That's not a good idea.
This is just an irresponsible escape from reality to reduce the guilt I feel.
<Page3>
...... I need to calm down now.
If you really want to defeat the vampire.
If you truly want to reduce the number of casualties, you must understand that you have to endure here for now.
<Page4>
Still...still, three days is too long.
<Page5>
"...... Arcueid.
I thought you said my duty as a guard ended yesterday.”
<Page6>
"I did, but ...... what, you're still scared?"
"No, that's not what I meant. If it’s going to be cooperation from here on out, and not obligation, then I want you to do me a favour.
I will do as you say. I'll follow your instructions. I may not be able to act as your shield ......, but I can at least use a knife.
So, in return..."
<Page7>
"In return?"
"I can't wait three days. Let’s lure him out tonight.
<Page8>
"Um, ......, are you serious?
Do you want to die? Arcueid was taken aback.
I know it's dangerous. Even so, there is a line that cannot be compromised.
<Page9>
"I don't know if I can say this in jest.
I don't want to die either. So let me ask you. With you resting until tonight, and my eyes, can you defeat Vlov?
<Page10>
Arcueid is the only one who can measure that.
So if ...... she decides she can, then I'll bet on that possibility.
<Page11>
"...... Yes. If Shiki does what I say, we'll be stronger.
But is that what you want?　It's safer to wait three days, okay?
"...... I know. I know, but this is the limit of my tolerance. My mind can't take much more than that.
<Page12>
"Hmm. ...... Well, that's good then.
And let’s face it, there was little chance we’d get away with it for three days.”
<Page13>
"So, we’re changing course now, let’s have a strategy meeting.
Where do you want to fight, Shiki?”
"What?　No, is it really ...... okay?
<Page14>
I couldn’t help but ask back.
I didn’t think that Arcueid, who was so serious about fighting, would be so willing to listen to my request so easily.
<Page15>
"I told you that would be fine.
Will we be able to get away with escaping for three days, or will we kill Vlov tonight?
They both have the same success rate. The only difference is your chance of survival.”
<Page16>
"...... I see. Thank you, Arcueid.”
"I wouldn't recommend it, though.
I really don't understand you, Shiki.”
<Page17>
I’ve narrowed down my own chances of defeating Vlov.
It is  no wonder that Arcueid, who values efficiency and certainty, is dismayed.
Still, Arcueid did not say ‘no’.
<Page18>
I wondered whether she respected my feelings or if it was because the odds were same both ways?
Well, either way, I'm glad that she understood.
