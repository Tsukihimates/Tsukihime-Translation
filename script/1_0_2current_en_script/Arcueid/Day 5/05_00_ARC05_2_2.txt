".................." 
...... I know. 
If I want to return to a decent life as a human being, I should run away. 
I'm fine with that. It's the best choice for me. 
But,
<Page2>
What about Arcueid? 
<Page3>
No, it's not about Arcueid, it's about me. 
If I'm here, and involved with Arcueid, I'm bound to run into him.
<Page4>
He's crazy. 
Before him being a vampire, or his flames, or anything else, his eyes are most out of the ordinary. 
<Page5>
His emotions are dead. 
He is cold in all things. 
To him even the lives of vampires don't matter, let alone the lives of humans, 
It's impossible to stand in front of him again. 
I myself, who almost got killed once, realized it above all.
<Page6>
--Refuse.
That's what I should do.
No matter what I think, he's not someone whom I can handle.
<Page7>
"---Arcueid, I'm ---- 
But am I right about this? 
Am I going to abandon this girl?
Abandon the girl who can't even move properly because of me.
<Page8>
"---- I'm ----." 
Am I going to run away? 
Will I run away from that monster that mercilessly and ruthlessly burned up so many people despite having no interest in them?
Do I pretend that I didn't see it, that I'm the only one who survived, and run away without any remorse of conscience?
<Page9>
"-------" 
The lines of death that only I can see. 
I was told by someone important to me that I had these two eyes because there are times when I would really need them. 
<Page10>
Then the answer is obvious.
I can't shake off my doubts and fears, and I don't know what I can do. 
But still...I can tell what I don't want to do. 
<Page11>
"Shiki?" 
"...... Arcueid. I don't know what you're talking about. 
No matter how different a creature he is, no matter how helpless I am, my responsibility remains the same. After all, I've let many people die, and I don't want that to happen again. 
I can't just run away now...." 
<Page12>
I looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath. 
Fortunately, my resolve was solidified by it. 
<Page13>
"---I'm going to defeat that vampire. #I think that's the responsibility I should take, being the only one who survived in that hotel." 
<Page14>
I reply to her as if I were talking to myself.
Arcueid sighed heavily for once, as if blaming herself.
