"........."
...I already know.
If I want to return to a normal life as a human being, I should just run away.
I'm fine with that. For me, that's simply the best choice.
But,
<Page2>
What about Arcueid?
<Page3>
No, rather than Arcueid, this is about me.
If I stay here――― If I become involved with Arcueid, I'm bound to run into him.
<Page4>
That guy is crazy.
Even more than him being a vampire or the flames, his eyes are full of madness.
<Page5>
His emotions are dead.
Everything about him is cold.
That's why even the lives of <vampires|allies> don't matter to him, let alone humans.
There's no way I could stand in front of him again.
I realized this fact above all, as I'm someone who has nearly been killed once already.
<Page6>
―――I'll refuse.
That's why I have to refuse.
No matter what I think, this is not an opponent that I can handle.
<Page7>
"―――Arcueid, I――――"
But is this really the right decision?
Am I really going to abandon this woman?
It's my fault. Am I really going to abandon this woman who can't even move properly because of me?
<Page8>
"――――Am I――――"
going to run away?
Am I really going to run away from that monster that burned all those people ruthlessly and mercilessly without a care?
Am I really going to pretend like I didn't see it, run away and survive alone without a shred of conscience?
<Page9>
"―――――――"
The lines of death that only I can see.
I was told by someone I hold dear that I was endowed with these eyes for times of great necessity.
<Page10>
...In that case, the answer is clear.
I can't shake off my doubts and fears, and I don't know what I'll be able to do.
But still――― Even a person like me can say what I don't want to do.
<Page11>
"―――Shiki?"
"...Arcueid. I don't understand what you're talking about.
No matter how much of a monster he is, no matter how powerless I am, my responsibility is still the same. As I thought, I let many people die, and I don't want to see anyone else meet that fate.
...That's why I can't run away by myself after all this."
<Page12>
I look up at the ceiling and take a deep breath.
My resolve strengthens as a result.
<Page13>
"―――I will defeat that vampire.# I believe this is the responsibility I need to take as the only survivor from that hotel."
<Page14>
I reply to her like I'm talking to myself.
Arcueid lets out a single, heavy sigh, almost as if she's criticizing herself.
