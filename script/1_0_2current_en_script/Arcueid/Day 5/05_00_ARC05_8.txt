<Page1>
His chest has been pierced. 
A great deal of blood is spilled.
The plug of Vlov's blood bath gets pulled.
<Page2>
The burning <delusion|dream  > comes to an end.
She crosses over the final boundary. 
And then,
with a scream that rips through the world, the vampire's true form is revealed.
<Page3>
The atmosphere creaks. 
The atomic activity switches from fast to slow.
Electrons are repelled by the solidified ultra-cold rift, depriving them of a place to go and causing them to react.
<Page4>
The blue flames that covered the ground's surface were not flames.
They were something like heat lost from the earth, similar to vaporization heat. 
<Page5>
"―――Ah, it's true." 
A cold-blooded arm hangs in the air.
The palm of his hand unfolds as if he craves the warm heat.
<Page6>
"――― This place is cold."
The white beauty in front of him gets swallowed completely.
<Page7>
"――――――, Eh?" 
Rather than a drop in temperature, it is like the world has changed without warning.
<Page8>
The river of ice released from Vlov not only blew away Arcueid, but also the city behind her. 
<Page9>
It didn't take more than 2 seconds. 
The glacier reached the buildings on the surface and froze everything in an instant. 
...What if.
If there were people in that building that had still not evacuated, then every single one of them would have their heat come to an end.
<Page10>
My body trembles at the unbelievable scene in front of me.
I become terrified at the prospect of what could happen next.
It's just a coincidence that I'm still alive.
If my location had been in the same direction as Arcueid's, I would have been frozen alive by now.
<Page11>
The river of flames that spread outwards was a slow-moving disaster.
People were running away faster than the fire was able to spread.
But that glacier formed in an instant.
Its range is small and the cold wave only crawls on the ground, but if one were to be caught by it, they would be killed without any chance to escape.
<Page12>
If by some chance that guy makes it out to the ground above, everyone in front of him will die without a chance...!
<Page13>
"――― Arcueid. 
That's right, where's Arcueid...!?" 
<Page14>
I hang on to my one and only hope.
The only one who can stop that monster is her.
<Page15>
"There she is...!" 
In the middle of the icy river lies the figure of Arcueid.
Thank god... Come to think of it, that girl is also really tough.
She's standing there in that cold ice without a single scratch...! 
<Page16>
"...So that's how it is.
It's not that you were insane, but that you were running away from your sanity."
<Page17>
"Even a third-rate Dead Apostle can defeat a star as long as he has a Principle, huh? 
Thanks to that, I'm wide awake now. Vlov Arkhangel." 
<Page18>
Arcueid clears away the glacier.
Vlov stares at her with cold eyes.
Not with his past sickly eyes, but with those that precisely observe their prey, like a hunter in the snowfield. 
<Page19>
"...The one that should be wide awake is me.
How dare you take so much warmth away from me." 
<Page20>
His voice was like a blade filled with nothing but hatred. 
The vampire's fighting spirit has not faded. 
...No
To be more precise, it's like he is actually ready to fight for the first time.
<Page21>
"I see. Then accept your good fortune, Vlov. Normally, I would have finished you before you woke up. The one that saved your life was a despicable murderer. Well, for a short time at least." 
<Page22>
"...Indeed 
The one in front of me is far different from the one I have heard about in the stories.
...It appears that in this moment of truth, I've come across a fortune."
<Page23>
"I hate to say this, but it's true.
It seems that both of us only have one final attack remaining. In the end, one of us will commence the attack and the other will come to an end.
But before that, allow me to send some final gratitude."
<Page24>
"――― Answer me, puny livestock of mine own servitude.
Testimony of Ancestor. Lesion of the Root. Hollow like a grand vortex.
Descendant carrying new Principle.
What doest blood mean to thee?"
<Page25>
It was a stern voice that was far removed from the current situation.
Arcueid's question could be taken as a reprimand. 
After opening his eyes wide in surprise, Vlov says the following.
<Page26>
"――― Allow me to respond with respect. 
For me, blood is the very essence of warmth.
The heat of life. The elixir to cure my frostbite. That which turns my world and my Principle.
Indeed. Without blood, I would freeze to death in this blistering cold." 
The man reveals his own true colors in a voice that can be deemed as respectful.
<Page27>
"...I remember now.
A freak who hated and feared humans, drifting across an immense sea and setting up a castle to avoid them.
One of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors, Zaria Offenbaum. 
I heard that she ruled a land while possessing a Principle for over a thousand years without ever having children, but... I see.
In other words, you killed her and took it, didn't you?"
<Page28>
"...That's right. I am not a successor, I am simply a knight. At least I once was. An eternity and such is beyond my imagination." 
<Page29>
The vampire's right hand is pointed towards his own shadow.
From the long――― unnaturally long shadow, a huge weapon emerges. 
<Page30>
"But even for a family head, she was more than unworthy.
Therefore I took it. As a knight, I defeated the king and usurped his throne. And now this Principle has become my own personal curse."
"I see. It must have been a short reign." 
<Page31>
"...Well, aren't you arrogant. You are so weak that you can't even use a Marble Phantasm, and yet you decide to face me head on?"
"It doesn't matter. There is no need to materialize a world against a mere Dead Apostle. 
Against someone like you――― these claws are more than enough." 
"――――――" 
<Page32>
The edge of the vampire's mouth slants upwards.
The well-refined face turns into that of an ugly beast. 
He laughs at Arcueid's provocation in acknowledgement of her statement.
<Page33>
"The strongest ones are those who continue to change and remain unbiased.
...You are exactly that. Even as you decline to such an extent, you still have power remaining that surpasses my own.
A primordial one that deals with every curse and every situation――― No ordinary Dead Apostle can possibly compare." 
<Page34>
The air becomes distorted.
The blue fever of ill thoughts lowers the underground's temperature. 
<Page35>
Arcueid has no hesitation.
She charges Vlov head on, despite knowing that his strange weapon had the potential to defeat her.
　――― And then.
<Page36>
"But you don't understand.
Although her territory is a part of this planet, this is a biosphere that has been isolated for being unfit to live in.
Even a Princess of the True Ancestor like yourself cannot possibly endure a hell like this...!"
<Page37>
A cold wave of air spreads around Vlov.
Arcueid comes to a sudden halt and sticks her hands out in order to protect herself.
The wind blows fiercely, raising a piercing scream and enveloping the city in absolute zero. 
And then.
<Page38>
A huge lance of unworldly steel pulverizes her pure white dress. 
<Page39>
...The blizzard conceals my field of vision.
My exhaled breath comes out white.
<Page40>
Arcueid is blown dozens of meters away and collapsed on top of the wreckage.
The dress that had been repelling the flames is shattered.
Her body reverts back to her former self.
<Page41>
"...You monster. To think that you still remain intact after a blow from my lance.
However―――" 
<Page42>
Arcueid remains collapsed and does not get up.
Without moving an inch, Vlov holds up his right hand as if to signal something. 
The rubble around Vlov crumbles. 
Several corpses from beneath the ground crawl out as they groan.
<Page43>
"This hunt now belongs to me.
Go forth and pick up the woman's corpse. 
That adaptability. That all-powerful blood surpassing all anguish, in these hands."
<Page44>
The corpses walk up to Arcueid at Vlov's command.
<Page45>
The winner has been decided. 
Our strategy has failed.
Vlov cannot be sealed by the chains anymore.
Arcueid has been defeated, and the city is engulfed in a cold wave. 
Everything around me will die.
I stand right in front of it all, watching the final scene unfold before my eyes―――
