<Page1>
His chest is pierced.
A great deal of blood is spilled.
The plug holding in Vlov's blood has been removed.
<Page2>
The burning <delusion|d r e a m   > comes to an end.
She crosses the final boundary.
And then,
with a scream that rips through the world, the vampire's true form is revealed.
<Page3>
The atmosphere creaks.
The atomic activity switches from fast to slow.
Electrons are repelled by the solidified ultra-cold rift, depriving them of a place to go and causing them to react.
<Page4>
The blue flames that covered the ground's surface were not flames.
They were something like heat lost from the earth, similar to that observed during vaporization.
<Page5>
"―――Ah, it's true."
A cold-blooded arm hangs in the air.
The palm of his hand opens as if seeking warmth.
<Page6>
"―――This place is cold."
The white beauty in front of him is swallowed completely.
<Page7>
"――――――, Eh?"
Moreso than just a drop in temperature, it was like the world itself had changed.
<Page8>
The river of ice released from Vlov not only blew away Arcueid, but also the city behind her.
<Page9>
It took less than two seconds.
The glacier reached the buildings on the surface and froze everything in an instant.
...What if.
If there were people in that building who hadn't yet evacuated, every single one of them would have had their heat stolen. // あらゆる熱を停止させた。This line is so weird but I decided to mostly keep it as is because it's shiki sort of unable to accept
<Page10>
My body trembles at the unbelievable scene in front of me.
I'm terrified at the prospect of what might happen next.
It's just a coincidence that I'm still alive.//ruby dots <た|・><ま|・><た|・><ま|・>
If I had been behind Arcueid, I would've been frozen where I stood.
<Page11>
The expanding river of flames was a slow-moving disaster.
People were running away faster than the fire was able to spread.
But that glacier formed in an instant.
Its range is small and the cold wave only crawls on the ground, but if one were to be caught by it, they would be killed without any chance to escape.
<Page12>
If that guy manages to get above ground, anyone in front of him would die without a chance to escape...!
<Page13>
"―――Arcueid.
That's right, where's Arcueid...!?"
<Page14>
I hang on to my one and only hope.
She's the only one who can stop that monster.
<Page15>
"There she is...!"
In the middle of the icy river lies the figure of Arcueid.
Thank goodness... That girl really is tough as well.// kinda stripped some meaning here というか、あいつもたいがい頑丈だ。'も' is totally gone here.
She's standing there in that cold ice without a scratch...!
<Page16>
"...So that's how it is.
It's not that you've lost your sanity, you're just running away from it."
<Page17>
"Even a third-rate Dead Apostle can defeat a planet as long as he has a Principle, huh.//to be rechecked, We may want to translate 星 as planet
Thanks to that, I'm wide awake now, Vlov Arkhangel."
<Page18>
Arcueid clears away the glacier.
Vlov stares at her with cold eyes.
Not with the sickly eyes from before, but with eyes that carefully observe their prey like a hunter in a snowfield.
<Page19>
"...I'm the one who should say such things.
How dare you take so much warmth from me."
<Page20>
His voice was like a blade, filled with nothing but hatred.
The vampire's fighting spirit has not faded.
...No.
To be more precise, it's like he is actually ready to fight for the first time.
<Page21>
"I see. Then accept your good fortune, Vlov. Normally, I would have finished you before you woke up. The one that saved your life was a despicable murderer. Well, for a short time at least."
<Page22>
"―――Indeed.
The one in front of me is far different from the one I have heard about in the stories.
...It appears that in this moment of truth, fortune smiles upon me."
<Page23>
"I hate to say it, but that's right.
It seems that both of us only have one final attack remaining. In the end, one of us will commence the attack and the other will come to an end.
But before that, allow me to send some final gratitude."
<Page24>
"―――Answer me, puny livestock of mine own servitude.
Testimony of Ancestor. Lesion of the Root. Hollow like a grand vortex.
Descendant carrying new Principle.
What doth blood mean to thee?"
<Page25>
It was a stern voice, far removed from the current situation.
Arcueid's question could be taken as a reprimand.
After opening his eyes wide in surprise, Vlov says the following.
<Page26>
"―――Allow me to respond with respect.
For me, blood is the very essence of warmth.
The heat of life. The elixir to cure my frostbite. That which turns my world and my Principle.
Indeed. Without blood, I would freeze to death in this blistering cold."
The man reveals his own true colors in a voice that could be described as respectful.
<Page27>
"...I remember now.
A freak who hated and feared humans, drifting across an immense sea and setting up a castle to avoid them.
One of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors, Zaria Offenbaum.
I heard that she ruled a land while possessing a Principle for over a thousand years without ever having children, but...... I see.
In other words, you killed her and took it, didn't you?"//ruby dots <殺|・><し|・><て|・><奪|・><っ|・><た|・><の|・><ね|・>
<Page28>
"...That's right. I am not a successor, I am simply a knight. At least I once was. Eternity and other such concepts are well beyond my comprehension."
<Page29>
The vampire's right hand is pointed toward his own shadow.
From the long―――unnaturally long shadow, a huge weapon emerges.//ruby dots <得|・><物|・>
<Page30>
"But even for a family head, she was worse than unworthy.
Therefore I took it. As a knight, I defeated the king and usurped his throne. And now this Principle has become my own personal curse."
"I see. It must have been a short reign."
<Page31>
"...Well, aren't you an arrogant one? You are so weak that you cannot even use a Marble Phantasm, and yet you decide to face me head-on?"
"It doesn't matter. There is no need to materialize a world against a mere Dead Apostle.
Against someone like you――― these claws are more than enough."
"――――――"
<Page32>
The edges of the vampire's mouth slant upwards.
His refined face turns into that of an ugly beast.
He laughs at Arcueid's provocation in acknowledgment of her statement.
<Page33>
"The strongest ones are those who continue to change and remain unbiased.
...You are exactly that. Even as you decline to such an extent, you still have power remaining that surpasses my own.
A primordial one that deals with every curse and every situation―――No ordinary Dead Apostle can possibly compare."
<Page34>
The air becomes distorted.
The blue fever of ill thoughts lowers the temperature underground.
<Page35>
Arcueid has no hesitation.
She charges Vlov head-on, despite knowing that his strange weapon has the potential to defeat her.
―――And then.
<Page36>
"But you do not understand.
Although her territory is a part of this planet, this is a biosphere that has been isolated as being unfit to live in.
Even a Princess of the True Ancestors like yourself cannot possibly endure a hell like this...!"
<Page37>
A cold wave of air spreads around Vlov.
Arcueid comes to a sudden halt and sticks her hands out in order to protect herself.
The wind blows fiercely, amplifying to a piercing scream, and envelopes the city in absolute zero.
And then.
<Page38>
A huge lance of unworldly steel pulverizes her pure white dress.
<Page39>
...The blizzard blocks my field of vision.
My breath comes out white.
<Page40>
Arcueid is blown dozens of meters back and collapses on top of the wreckage.
The dress that had been repelling the flames is shattered.
She reverts to her former self.
<Page41>
"...You monster. To think that you still remain intact after a blow from my lance.
However―――"
<Page42>
Arcueid remains collapsed and does not get up.
Without moving an inch, Vlov holds up his right hand as if to signal something.
The rubble around Vlov crumbles.
Several corpses from beneath the ground crawl out as they groan.
<Page43>
"This hunt now belongs to me.
Go forth and pick up the woman's corpse.
That adaptability. That all-powerful blood surpassing all anguish, in these hands."
<Page44>
The corpses walk up to Arcueid at Vlov's command.
<Page45>
The winner has been decided.
Our strategy has failed.
Vlov cannot be sealed by the chains anymore.
Arcueid has been defeated, and the city is engulfed in a cold wave.
Everything around me will die.
I stand right in front of it all, watching the final scene unfold before my eyes―――
