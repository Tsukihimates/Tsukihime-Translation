"...Well, you're not wrong.
I'd really prefer a pair though. Two women or a man and a woman."
"It's fine though. Welcome to the club, Otaku-kun!
We've been troubled by the lack of challengers lately! If we don't meet our quota, we'll be killed too!"
<Page2>
Letting out a cackle, the man called Haru circles around to my back.
He blocks my path of retreat.
<Page3>
"Well, I guess it's fine to have a lone guy once in a while.
I'll take you to the part-time venue."
The man named Haru pushes a button in the elevator.
<Page4>
A mechanical sound echoes in the darkness.
This seems to be the only place that has electricity.
<Page5>
"Get in."
"......"
...I don't know if I should go into the elevator.
Once I enter, I'll be locked inside.
If the two men were to seize me, I wouldn't be able to resist with my current strength.
<Page6>
...I need to think about this carefully.
I should,
1. Ask about the details. ^@t2. Refuse.
"...!"
A sudden shock knocks me unconscious.
My hypothalamus malfunctions,
and the autonomic nerves controlling my limbs disconnect.
<Page7>
"Yeah! Strrrrriiiike!!"
...I hear a lively voice in the background.
I was hit in the back of my head with something like a bat.
<Page8>
"What a pain in the ass.
This ain't no time to get all worked up, you shithead."
<Page9>
...The elevator descends.
In my dazed state, I can see the button labeled 'B1' glowing.
...B1... The first basement floor... Are they sending me to an underground parking lot...?
<Page10>
...Shit.
My consciousness is stable, but my vision is blurry.
My arms and legs are flapping up and down even though I'm not giving such commands.
I feel a slimy and unpleasant sensation on my face.
<Page11>
As the elevator doors open, we're illuminated by an intense light.
It's too bright to see what's going on outside.
"We're dropping him. Give me a hand."
"Sheesh, we're going straight to M and not P! How relentless, Toshi!"
<Page12>
...The duo lift up my body, carry me out of the elevator, and place me on the floor.
I thought I was going to be thrown off, but the way they operated was strangely cautious.
<Page13>
...The footsteps get further away.
...The duo takes the elevator and leaves the area.
<Page14>
"―――, ――――――"
Regardless, I'm okay.
I'm still alive. It's a serious wound, but it's not fatal.
<Page15>
I don't know where I am, but in a few more minutes, the paralysis in my limbs will subside and I'll be able to move again.
When that happens, I can fight back.
<Page16>
This time I'll be on my guard. I'll get a hold of one of those two and get some information out of―――
<Page17>
"―――Eh?"
The last remaining piece of my consciousness freezes in its tracks.
<Page18>
What is this place?
    ―――Air like membrane tissue.
What is this place?
    ―――The stench of fat, meat, and blood.
What is this place?
    ―――A great number of prison bars and living corpses.
What is this place...?
<Page19>
This is not an underground parking space.
This is not a place on Earth.
There's no way that a cesspool like this exists in a modern city.
<Page20>
"Ha, ah―――"
Something is coming. I hear a great number of footsteps.
I have a headache.
I feel nauseous.
The footsteps are getting closer.
My instincts are screaming that if I stay here, I'll be attacked.
<Page21>
"Aa, h―――"
My legs still won't move.
A large crowd gradually approaches, their rotten flesh trailing behind them.
"Aaaaa―――!"
I can't move. I can't move.
My legs won't move an inch, even as I cry and pour all of my strength into them!
<Page22>
"Kh, aa, h―――!"
I crawl along the blood and feces-stained floor with my hands.
I need to do something. It doesn't matter what.
I need to get out of here as soon as possible.
The elevator.
If I can get back to that elevator, I'm sure I'll be able to get back to the normal world.
<Page23>
I need to hurry.
I need to hurry.
Faster. Faster.
It's okay, I'm going to make it.
I will definitely be saved.
That elevator. That elevator.
If only I could just reach the elevator, stuck in the air like a gondola―――
