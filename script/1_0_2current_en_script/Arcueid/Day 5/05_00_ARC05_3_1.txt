"...Well, you're not wrong. 
I'd really prefer a pair though. Two women or a man and a woman."
"It's fine, welcome to the club, Otaku-kun!
We've been worried because we haven't had any challengers lately! If we didn't meet our quota, we would have been killed as well!"
<Page2>
With a cackling laugh, the man called Haru circles around to my back.
He blocks my path of retreat to prevent me from escaping.
<Page3>
"Okay, I guess it's fine to have a single guy once in a while.
I'll take you to the part-time venue."
The man named Haru pushes the button for the elevator. 
<Page4>
A mechanical sound echoes in the darkness. 
This seems to be the only place that has electricity.
<Page5>
"Get in." 
"......" 
...I don't know if I should go into the elevator like this.
Once I enter, I'll be locked inside.
If the two men were to seize me, I would not be able to resist with my physical strength.
<Page6>
...Let's think about this carefully.
I should,
1. Ask more about the details. ^@t2. Refuse.
"...!"
A sudden shock knocks me unconscious. 
My hypothalamus malfunctions,
and the autonomic nerves controlling my limbs disconnect.
<Page7>
"Yeah! Straaaaike!"
...I hear a lively voice in the background. 
I was hit in the back of my head with something like a bat.
<Page8>
"What a pain in the ass. 
This ain't no time to get so worked up, you shithead."
<Page9>
...The elevator descends.
In my dazed state, I can see the button that is labeled 'B1' glowing.
...B1... The first basement floor... Are they sending me to an underground parking lot...?
<Page10>
...Shit.
My consciousness is stable, but my vision is blurry.
My arms and legs are flapping up and down even though I'm not giving such commands.
I feel a slimy and unpleasant sensation on the face of my collapsed body.
<Page11>
As the elevator opens, it becomes illuminated by an intense light.
It's too bright to see what is going on outside.
"We're dropping him. Give me a hand."
"Sheesh, we're going straight to M and not P! How relentless, Toshi!"
<Page12>
...The duo lifts my body and carries me out of the elevator, placing me on the floor.
I thought I was going to be thrown off, but the way they operated was strangely cautious.
<Page13>
...The footsteps get further away.
...The duo takes the elevator and leaves the area.
<Page14>
"―――, ――――――"
In any case, I'm safe.
I'm still alive. It's a serious wound, but it's not fatal.
<Page15>
I don't know where I am, but in a few more minutes, the paralysis in my limbs will subside and I will be able to move.
When that happens, I can fight back.
<Page16>
This time I'll be on my guard. I'll get a hold of one of those two and get some information out of―――
<Page17>
"―――Eh?"
My one and only remaining piece of consciousness freezes in place.
<Page18>
What is this place?
    ―――An air like a membrane tissue.
What is this place?
    ―――The stench of fat, meat, and blood.
What is this place?
    ―――A great number of prison bars and living corpses.
What is this place...?
<Page19>
This is not an underground parking space.
This is not a place on Earth.
There's no way that this manure reservoir-looking view exists in our city.
<Page20>
"Ha, ah―――"
Something is coming. I hear a great number of footsteps.
I have a headache.
I feel nauseous.
The sound of footsteps is getting closer.
My instincts scream that I will be attacked if I just stay here.
<Page21>
"Aa, h―――"
My legs still won't move.
A large crowd gradually approaches, dragging their rotten flesh with them.
"Aaaaa―――!"
I can't move. I can't move.
My legs won't move an inch even as I cry and pour all of my strength!
<Page22>
"Kh, aa, h―――!"
I crawl along the floor smeared in blood and feces with my hands.
I need to do something. It doesn't matter what.
I need to get out of here as soon as possible.
The elevator.
If I can get back to that elevator, I'm sure I'll be able to go back to the normal world.
<Page23>
I need to hurry.
I need to hurry.
Faster. Faster.
It's okay, I'm going to make it.
I will definitely be saved.
That elevator. That elevator.
If only I could reach that elevator stuck in the air like a gondola―――
