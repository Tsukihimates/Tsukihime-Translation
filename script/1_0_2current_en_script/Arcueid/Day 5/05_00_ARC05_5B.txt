It was just like a human missile.
Arcueid descended from a height of 80 meters above ground towards Vlov.
<Page2>
No, it was more like she flew.
While in the air, she took aim and angled herself before accelerating like a missile.
<Page3>
Sand and debris spewed up in the air.
The wind whipped up a cloud of dust that sweeps the area.
The river of flame that spread across the downtown area is eradicated by that single blow.
<Page4>
The policemen that surrounded Vlov in the distance were blown away, with most of them becoming out of action. They got divided into two groups. Those who became unconscious after suffering a head injury and those who lost their will to fight from the sudden explosion.
That's not surprising.
<Page5>
"C-C..."
After the dust had settled, this was the result.
Arcueid's rapid descent not only shattered the area around Vlov, but also a large portion of the downtown area at the northern gate.
<Page6>
So that's what she meant by 'dropping them underground'.
The height of the land subsided over 40 meters.
<Page7>
It felt like watching an incredible force of nature. Its grandeur is on the same level as the Amazon jungle or the Niagara Falls.
"Cut me some slack, you idiot――――!"
Of course, I'm not praising her in the slightest.
<Page8>
"But damn that was cool. Was that by accident, or was it part of her plan!?"
There are no casualties from what I can from the rooftop.
The policemen who were outside the blast radius tended to the knocked-out officers and withdrew from the site of the explosion to escape.
<Page9>
As a result, this entire area is now completely deserted.
This――― this method of clearing out people is way over the top...!
<Page10>
"......!"
Did that flame come from Vlov?
Whether Arcueid missed or Vlov dodged the attack, either way, he is still alive.
<Page11>
...A monster that doesn't go down even from a strike like that.
As if to chase it down,
a white shadow challenges the flame source in the cloud of dust.
<Page12>
'Make sure you find me afterward―――'
Arcueid's words surface from the back of my mind.
...I'll think about that stuff later.
Right now, I need to hurry and get to the ground...!
<Page13>
"Hah, hah, hah, ha―――!"
I run down the stairs.
I cut the lock of the door to the rooftop with a knife.
<Page14>
"...Hah, hah, ha―――ah."
I run down the stairs while relying on the emergency lights.
...The feeling of resolve I have is disrupted by my erratic breathing.
<Page15>
All I have to do is cut through Vlov's 'line'.
First, Arcueid will battle him and then restrain him with her chains.
And then that's where I come in.
I'll approach him, cut through his lines and dismantle his body.
<Page16>
Arcueid's plunge back then was extraordinary.
So I can say it's possible that Vlov can be pinned down.
However―――
<Page17>
"―――But, still―――"
...Still, Vlov is in good condition.
Will Arcueid's view of him still remain the same?
If her assessment was wrong by any chance, Arcueid will be handicapped by her wound.
<Page18>
...In the worst-case scenario, I would have to fight Vlov alone―――
No, that's not possible.
There was no worst-case scenario in our minds. It's not that we didn't think about it, but that there was no reason to think about it at all.
<Page19>
That's because if Arcueid is to be defeated by Vlov, the only choice I would have left is to run away.
<Page20>
"Hah――――――hah."
I reach the elevator.
I head inside and press the button for the first floor.
There's no more time for hesitation.
This is no time to hesitate in the first place.
I take a deep breath. I check my condition. I can move properly at the very least.
<Page21>
It's only the fingers holding the knife that are frozen in place, as if they were not part of my body.
<Page22>
"――――――"
Could this be fear?
Am I afraid of confronting the violence... of confronting that monster?
If that's the case, then it's fine.
It's normal for people to be afraid of that thing. Of facing someone that could kill you just from being nearby. How could you call yourself human if you weren't afraid of that?
<Page23>
That's why,
if there is a problem, it would be,
<Page24>
"――――――"
...That is,
rather than being killed, it is killing him that I should be afraid of.
<Page25>
"Ha―――――h."
My breathing speeds up.
My heart is pounding restlessly like it's a different part of my body.
<Page26>
...I reach the first floor.
I fix the grip on my knife and run towards the newly formed explosion site.
