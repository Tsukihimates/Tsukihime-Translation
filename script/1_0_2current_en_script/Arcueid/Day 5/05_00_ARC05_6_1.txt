The location of the enemy is clear.
Down there lies Vlov, who we've come to defeat,
with Arcueid, who I promised to fight alongside.
<Page2>
The battle between those two has already begun.
...It's okay. My role here is not to fight, it's to finish the job.
When Arcueid gets a hold of Vlov, that's when I come in and sever his 'lines'.
And for that reason―――
<Page3>
"That's right. This is no time to be scared...!"
I slide down the slope of rubble and descend into the sunken ground.
I immediately cover my nose and mouth with one hand.
It isn't an intentional act, but an act of reflex in order to protect my life.
<Page4>
"―――"
I can't breathe.
There is oxygen here. I already established from the fight in the hotel that these blue flames are simply a curse and not a combustion of matter.
<Page5>
But that doesn't change the fact that it's sweltering in here. If I just breathe normally, the hot air will burn my lungs to a crisp.
<Page6>
A vampire in white and a vampire in a black cloak can be seen ahead.//to be rechecked "A vampire in a black mantle, cloak"
The clash of sword with claw.
Even in this heat, Arcueid is fighting Vlov with everything she's got without faltering.
<Page7>
As far as I can see, Arcueid has the upper hand.
If things continue like this, she will get a hold of Vlov just as we planned.
The problem is―――
<Page8>
"―――――――――"
It's a matter of how long my body can last.
My body# is already# starting to burn.
<Page9>
But strangely, I don't feel any pain.
I don't need to take a breath to know what's going on.
With the knife in my hand, I continue to wait for the right moment to defeat Vlov.
Like a sprinter waiting for the starting gun.
Or maybe like a ghost that will never move again.
<Page10>
I'll keep waiting.
And waiting.
And waiting.
Even as my eyeballs dry up, smolder, and turn to ashes, I wait.
No matter how long I wait, that moment will never come.
Just as I never come to notice that I've become little more than burnt up film.
