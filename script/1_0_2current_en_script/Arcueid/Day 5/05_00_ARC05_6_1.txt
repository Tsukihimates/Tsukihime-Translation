The location of the enemy is clear.
Down there lies Vlov who must be defeated,
alongside with Arcueid who I promised to fight with.
<Page2>
The battle between the two has already begun.
...... It's okay. My role here is not to fight. It's to finish the job.
When Arcueid gets a hold of Vlov, that's when I come in and sever his 'lines'.
And for that reason―――
<Page3>
"That's right. This is no time to be scared......!"
I slide down the slope of rubble and descend into the sunken ground.
I immediately cover my mouth and nose with one hand.
It was not an intentional act, but an act of reflex in order to protect my life.
<Page4>
"―――"
I can't breathe.
There is oxygen here. I already established from the fight in the hotel that these blue flames are simply a curse and not a combustion of matter.
<Page5>
But that doesn't change the fact that it's sweltering in here. If I just breathe normally, the hot air will burn my lungs to a crisp.
<Page6>
A vampire in white and a vampire in black can be seen ahead.
The clash of sword with claw.
Even in this heat, Arcueid is fighting Vlov with everything she's got without faultering.
<Page7>
As far as I can see, Arcueid has the upper hand.
If things continue like this, she will get a hold of Vlov just as we planned.
The problem is―――
<Page8>
"―――, ――――――"
It's a matter of how long my body can last.
My body #is already #starting to burn.
<Page9>
But strangely, I don't feel any pain.
I don't need to take a breath to know what's going on.
With the knife in my hand, I continue to wait for that moment to defeat Vlov.
Like a sprinter waiting for the starting gun.
Or maybe like a ghost that will never move again.
<Page10>
Keep waiting.
Keep waiting.
Keep waiting.
Even as my eyeballs dry up, smolder, and turn to ashes, I wait.
For eternity, the moment will never come.
I don't even realize I'm no more than a burned-in film
