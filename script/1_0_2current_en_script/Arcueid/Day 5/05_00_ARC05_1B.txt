<Page1>
"Are you up, Shiki?"
Arcueid pokes her head out of the kitchen.
<Page2>
"Hmph. What's with that scary face, did something happen?"
Arcueid talks to me freely in a natural manner.
<Page3>
"N-No. It's nothing. Uhh... well, g-good morning."
<Page4>
"Yeah, good morning!
Hehe. It's rare for me to greet someone in the morning like this."
<Page5>
"――――――"
Her unexpected smile takes my breath away.
Because of that, my chilling thoughts suddenly disappear as a result.
<Page6>
...But rather, this is no time to be relaxed!
I only got up because she wasn't in bed in the first place!
<Page7>
"Arcueid, is your wound okay?"
"Wound?# Yeah, it should be fine for now."
<Page8>
Arcueid stands there, looking comfortable.
She looks like she's entirely back to normal. Hell, she might even be healthier than I am.
<Page9>
"...I see. I'm happy to hear that―――"
I'm glad that at least the people close to me are safe.
"...Hmm?"
No, what am I thinking?
Arcueid isn't human.
To forget such an important fact, maybe I really am half-asleep after all.
<Page10>
"...But even so, it doesn't change the fact that this is a good thing.
I'm glad your wound wasn't that big of a deal after all."
"Oh, what's the matter, Shiki? You were calling me a monster just a while ago."
<Page11>
"You know. I still feel that way, but the situation has changed. It's only natural that I'd feel grateful to my savior."
<Page12>
"Savior? You mean me?"
<Page13>
Arcueid's eyes open wide in surprise.
By the looks of it, it seems like she doesn't consider it praiseworthy.
<Page14>
"That's right. You're the one who saved me.
...So, I know it's a bit late, but thank you for protecting me. If you hadn't pulled me out of the way, I would've been burned to death as well."
<Page15>
"'Thank you', you say―――it's fine, you don't have to go that far. Besides, I was the reason that you and Vlov met in the first place. I don't deserve that kind of gratitude."
<Page16>
"But, it's also true that you saved me. You were the one who covered for me. That alone is more than enough reason to thank you."
<Page17>
"...I guess it's true when you look at it that way...
But I still have to disagree, Shiki. If I hadn't made you watch over me, you never would've had to go through all that.
I'm the one that took away your normal life. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to hate me than feel gratitude towards me?"
<Page18>
Arcueid is obsessed with the strangest things.
Come on. Gratitude isn't something that can be explained with logic and reason; it's a matter of feeling.
<Page19>
"I'm not wrong.
I have to take responsibility for my own actions. Someone taught me that lesson long ago.
She told me that no matter what anyone around me thinks, I have to take that which I hold dear into my own hands."
<Page20>
That's why I don't feel any resentment or malice toward Arcueid for making me her guard.
At most, I would probably blame myself for getting caught up in this mess.
<Page21>
"―――I see. Now that you mention it, the reason that I needed a shield in the first place was because you were the one that killed me.
So are you saying that there's no need for me to apologize for getting you involved?"
<Page22>
"Yeah, that's exactly it. I'm just getting what I deserve, that's all."
<Page23>
"Getting what you deserve, huh.
Yeah, you were unlucky from the start, weren't you?
If you wanted to kill someone, you could have chosen someone other than me and this wouldn't have happened."
<Page24>
"...Hey now."
To begin with, the assumption that I would kill someone other than her is absurd.
<Page25>
To get such an urge, walk around aimlessly and eventually kill someone... The only time that had ever happened was with Arcueid.
Or to be precise, I don't think there is anyone other than her that I'd even want to―――
<Page26>
"―――Ah."
"What? Did you remember something just now?"
"No, it's not that I forgot something or anything like that... Come to think of it, why did I even want to kill you in the first place...?"
<Page27>
Arcueid looks at me, furrowing her brow.
It's a natural reaction.
After all, with me being the perpetrator, there's no way that Arcueid could know the reason I killed her.
<Page28>
"There was no reason for it, right?
Because you're a murderer at heart, after all."
"――――――Huh?"
<Page29>
Hold on.
What did this woman say to me just now―――?
<Page30>
"You were very skilled back then when you attacked me.
You pressed the bell, thrust your hand in the moment the door opened and then forcibly made your way inside.
During my state of shock, you put an end to my vital organs with your first attack before you sliced and tore my body into tiny pieces―――"
<Page31>
"Yeah, that surprise attack was absolutely flawless.
If you were to ask me how perfect it was, it was so perfect that if I were to put Shiki up on a canvas at that time, it would become a work of art unmatched by any other.
If I was still thinking straight, I would have taken you back to the castle as a decoration."
<Page32>
Arcueid says something bizarre in a somewhat captivated voice.
But, no, that's....
<Page33>
"Tha―――"
<Page34>
"But this time, you killed the wrong person.
I don't know how many people you've killed until now, but it must have been time for you to pay the price when you chose me as your next prey."
<Page35>
"Th-Th-That's..."
<Page36>
"What do you mean by 'Th-Th-That's'? And what's with the scary look on your face?
If you have something to say, then say it. After all we've been through, there's nothing to hold back between us now, right?"
<Page37>
She's right.
After I nod, I signal for Arcueid to come near me.
<Page38>
"What's that? A private talk?"
<Page39>
Arcueid comes over to me, brimming with excitement and anticipation.
I bring my mouth close to her ear in order to clearly get my point across.
<Page40>
"...You know, Arcueid."
"Yeah, what's up?"
Here I go,
<Page41>
"IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL, YOU STUPID WOMAN―――!"
<Page42>
You stupid woman-, oman-, n-.....
A full-blown scream echoes through the room.
I mercilessly assault Arcueid's eardrums as loud as I could muster.
<Page43>
"Ou...ch....."
Arcueid covers her ears exaggeratedly.
<Page44>
"Geez, how dare you! What do you think you're doing Shiki!"
<Page45>
"I'm the one who should be angry!
I knew something was off when you gave me a ridiculous order like that, but now I finally realize why!"
"Eh...? What do you mean 'realize'...?"
<Page46>
"I mean that you ordered me to become a shield against a monster, thinking that I was some kind of crazy murderer!
Oh come on, this is a huge misunderstanding!
Listen, I'm only going to say this once, I'm not a murderer or a crazy killer. You are――― you are the only person that I have ever killed in my life."
<Page47>
Arcueid's mouth hangs wide open.
It seems I've made her realize what she's put me through up to this point.
<Page48>
"―――No way. With skill like that, you're telling me that was your first time, Shiki...!?"
<Page49>
"...That's right. I may have these strange eyes, but even so, I've been trying to live a decent life as best as I can.
I've never thought even once about wanting to use these 'lines' to kill a person."
<Page50>
"...Hmm. If that's the case, why did you go and kill a complete stranger like me?"
"―――Well, that's because..."
<Page51>
Just before I was about to say that I didn't know, I become aware of my despicable nature.
<Page52>
"...At that moment, I...
I felt like I was going to throw up the moment I saw you on the street."
All I could think of was that white figure.
<Page53>
Without stopping the lust from smearing my presence,
a vulgar smile appeared on my lips.
<Page54>
"―――And so I was there, just like that.
Next thing I knew, with these hands, I―――"
<Page55>
In this very room,
for no reason or purpose,
I trampled all over that beautiful figure.
<Page56>
"―――――I see."
My body becomes weak.
Losing my ability to stand, I fall to my knees.
<Page57>
...Ah, that's right. I had no right to be mad at Arcueid.
Even if this person is alive and isn't human.
Because in reality, I killed her with my very own hands.
<Page58>
"Come on, why are you all quiet again?
What do you even mean by 'I see', Shiki?"
"......I'm saying, that I have... to say I'm sorry......"
<Page59>
Even with the incredibly abnormal situation, I forgot something very important.
I was so scared that I turned away from the thing I should have done in the first place.
<Page60>
"―――I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Arcueid.
I killed you, here in this room. Even though I should have apologized to you before anything else―――"
<Page61>
It's no wonder that Arcueid thought that I was a murderer.
I brazenly acted like a victim after doing all that without any confession or remorse.
Not only that, but I still don't even understand the impulse I had at that time―――
<Page62>
"...The truth is that I killed you.
That's why... I have to be punished. A killer like me, must not be allowed to blend in with the rest of society."
<Page63>
...It's too cowardly for me to talk about that fact after all this time.
A person who kills for no reason should never have a place in society in the first place.
<Page64>
"―――I see.
You really don't understand the reason yourself, do you?"
...I nod while I hang my head in shame.
<Page65>
"In other words, you didn't feel any pleasure from doing it, right?
...Yeah. It's true that there are serial killers out there that kill people as naturally as breathing, but you seem to be a very honest guy at heart."
"...I guess so. That was what I was trying to say, more or less."
<Page66>
"No, your level of honesty is much higher than that, Shiki.
So, was I really the only one you wanted to kill?"
"...Yeah. I've never felt that way about anyone else but you."
<Page67>
"Well then, in that case there's no problem.
Come on, lift your head, Shiki. You are nothing close to a murderer."
"......"
<Page68>
I raise my head as if I had been forgiven.
In front of me, I see a confident smile on the face of someone who looked past the act of killing her. A smile that believed in me more than I believed in myself.
<Page69>
"Besides, there's no need for you to be punished.
It just so happens that the person that you wanted to kill was me. And to make matters worse, you possessed an unparalleled skill for murder."
<Page70>
"But fortunately for you, I happen to be a vampire, so no one died in the end right?
That's why there's no reason for you to suffer. I don't think you have to worry about the ethics of human society either."
<Page71>
"Humans don't have the right to judge you. After all, the only ones in the world who can criticize you are me, the victim, and you, the assailant."
<Page72>
"―――I get what you're trying to say. But that still doesn't change the fact that I killed you, does it?"
<Page73>
That's right.
Even if it turns out that there will be no punishment under these unique circumstances,
my sin alone will remain unto eternity.
<Page74>
"Of course not. It's not like I've moved on and I still hold a bit of a grudge. It would be troubling if you moved on so quickly.
But you know what, Shiki? As long as you earnestly feel remorse and continue to regret it, then there's no problem, right?"
―――That's just sophistry.
<Page75>
"Shiki. Even among humans, there are people who will never sell their soul to the devil no matter how much they despise the world. For example, there are honest people who can say that they're sorry, even to a vampire.
That's why it's okay. No matter what anyone says, or even if you yourself want to say otherwise―――You can still belong to that side of the world."
<Page76>
"―――――"
...I'm speechless.
The nerve of this woman―――How could she say such a thing with a smile to her killer?
<Page77>
"Look, that aside, don't we have a bigger problem on our hands? Now that you're awake, we should talk about what we're going to# do#"
<Page78>
"!?"
It happened so suddenly.
Without any warning, Arcueid collapses to the floor with a smile on her face.
<Page79>
"Arcueid!?"
I rush over to her fallen body.
<Page80>
"...Well that's awkward. Perhaps I was too hasty after all."
Arcueid breathes with pain as sweat appears on her forehead.
...For a moment, I thought I saw a faint red color seeping through her shirt.
<Page81>
"Arcueid, your wound―――"
The wound from when she protected me at the hotel―――
<Page82>
"That was where Vlov got me, right? It's just healing slowly because of what you did to me.
I closed up the wound for now, but it seems that wasn't very effective."
<Page83>
Arcueid's tone is cheerful.
However, I finally come to realize that there was a faint sign of pain in her expression.
<Page84>
"...What exactly did you use to close the wound?"
"Ummm, that."
<Page85>
Arcueid points to an object lying on the wooden floor. A brown object. At first glance, it looks a bit like a baumkuchen, but looking at it closely, it's a roll of 100-yen duct tape.
<Page86>
"S-Stop being an idiot and get some rest!!!!
What kind of moron uses duct tape to close a wound...!?"
<Page87>
"...Geez, it's not nice to be calling people idiots all the time.
If you keep doing that, I might actually end up believing it myself."
"Be quiet. It's fine so just show me your wound...!"
<Page88>
I reach out for her white clothes.
...And then.
Arcueid rolls over on the bed with a flop.
<Page89>
"Don't be ridiculous, what are you going to do if that wound opens again!"
"It's fine, just leave it be.
You should stop acting stupid as well. Trying to strip a girl of her clothes, that makes you worse than a Dead Apostle."
<Page90>
"―――Hey now. I don't even see you as a human being, so stuff like male or female is irrelevant.
Come on, just be quiet and stay still. If you die from this wound after protecting me, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."
<Page91>
Arcueid glares at me in dissatisfaction, and just as I thought she would roll towards me...
<Page92>
"........"
She stands up reluctantly, stubbornly refusing to talk.
...It seems she's a bit sulky, but I guess it's okay to look at the wound now.
<Page93>
"Alright... Let's take a look at what kind of treatment you used."
"......"
Arcueid rolls up her clothes and exposes her abdomen.
<Page94>
"――――――You-"
I desperately hold back the urge to yell at her.
Not only did she cover the wound, but she wrapped so much duct tape around it that it covered her entire abdomen.
<Page95>
I put her clothes back on and carry her.
<Page96>
"Hey――what do you think you're doing, Shiki?"
"Making you sleep on the bed. As much as I want to take you to the hospital, we both know there's no way I can do that."
Just like that, I place her down on the bed as gently as I can.
<Page97>
"Listen, until I come back, you cannot move around, no matter what.
If you walk around like you did earlier, I'll forget about you and leave immediately, okay!?"
<Page98>
I look around the room.
...As I thought, there's no first aid kit or anything that can be used to treat the wound. She is someone that can just come back to life after all.
This may as well be the first time that this kind of thing has ever happened to her.
Right now I have... about 2,000 yen in cash... or so...
<Page99>
"...No, this is no time to be caring about pride.
Arcueid. You said that you were rich, right?"
"Y-Yeah. It's not like I live in discomfort or anything, why?"
<Page100>
"Cash, credit card, whatever you have just lend it to me. I'm going to buy some first aid.
...I don't know whether it will have any effect on you, but I'll try to give you some basic medical care."
<Page101>
"That's fine, but it might not make a difference, you know."
"I'll do it even if it won't. I can't just leave you here like this."
<Page102>
"...Got it. Maybe there's some meaning behind our bodies having the same structure after all."
<Page103>
'Here', says Arcueid as she hands over a few 10,000 yen bills.
...Not that it really matters, but did she just pop this stack of cash out of thin air?
<Page104>
"You should just lie down and stay quiet. Ah, but you can't fall asleep. Make sure that you stay awake even when you're lying down."
"Hmph... Shiki, you're asking for something extremely unreasonable."
<Page105>
"It's unreasonable, but do it anyways. Your bodily functions decrease when you go to sleep. Same goes for your immune system.
If you fall asleep with an open wound, it will just keep getting worse and worse.
Sleeping will only help you recover from fatigue, it won't heal wounds or illness. It's better for you to stay awake for now until I can patch you up."
<Page106>
"―――Hmm. Yeah, that sounds about right."
Arcueid smiles happily.
...As always, I have no idea what goes on inside her head.
<Page107>
"...Hey now. What exactly are you so happy about?"
"I'm happy because I can finally count on you."
<Page108>
"......"
I'm gonna go crazy.
I hold myself back from replying and focus on what I need to do at this moment.
For starters, I'll leave the room, take off my blood-stained jacket,
and go shopping―――
<Page109>
...However.
As I was about to leave, I notice something in the kitchen.
<Page110>
"―――It's food."
On the table, there was something prepared that's less like a meal and more like food. Actually, it was less like food and more like just ingredients. Something that can only be described as 'a food-like thing'.
So this was the reason why Arcueid was in the kitchen earlier.
<Page111>
Arcueid said that she doesn't eat ordinary meals.
I don't even have to think to figure out who this was prepared for.
<Page112>
"Oh come on―――what the hell is wrong with her?"
I'm getting irritated.
So irritated that I waste no time in dashing out to buy something I can use to give her first aid.
