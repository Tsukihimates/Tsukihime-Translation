<Page1>
It has to be throwing.
No, like a bullet to be precise.
Although he has become cautious, it doesn't change the fact that I am a lethal weapon to him.
<Page2>
Now it's just a matter of how to shoot it.
It's simple. If I can't get over there with my legs, I'll have to rely on something else...!
<Page3>
I run towards Arcueid in the rear.
"Shiki―――!"
I hear the sound of ice being smashed behind me.
The claw-shaped wind pressure generated by Arcueid seems to be accurate not only within her reach, but also at this distance.
<Page4>
"Geez, why did you come over here?! You'll just turn us into a single target!"
<Page5>
It's more favorable for Vlov to have his prey in a single spot.
Even I know that.
<Page6>
"I know, but this is the only way!
You tossed that debris just now, right?!
I need you to do the same thing with me!"
"Huh?!"
<Page7>
Or to be more precise, 'I need you to throw me'.
The debris from earlier was part of the floor that was close to three meters in length.
If she can throw something like that at that speed, then I can get there many times faster than if I were to run!
<Page8>
"I kind of understand what you're trying to say!
But won't you get knocked away en route?!"
"Normally, yes! But you can send out as many of those binding things as you want, right?!"
"―――Well, yeah I can."
<Page9>
Arcueid is hesitant, but right now there is no other choice.
I'll get her to bind me onto a piece of rubble big enough for me to hide behind and then throw it towards Vlov.
Naturally, I would get shot down if I was aimed directly at him.
If possible, it would be best if three pieces of debris were thrown.
<Page10>
The first shot should be aimed directly at Vlov,
the second shot should deliberately miss and land behind Vlov,
and the third shot should be aimed at Vlov again.
<Page11>
The one I'll hide behind is in the second shot.
Just before falling to the ground, I'll cut the 'lines' running through the rubble and get behind Vlov within two seconds...!
<Page12>
"Are you sure you wanna do that?
If we miss the timing, you'll become a crashing corpse!"//to be rechecked 衝突死体
"That's if we miss. If things go smoothly, we can kill him without getting hurt. This is the only way."
<Page13>
The barrage of ice spears grows in intensity.
We can't waste any more time here.
<Page14>
"―――I got it. So I just have to miss the debris that you're on while aiming for Vlov, right?"
"Yeah. I just need to pass him on the side."
<Page15>
I go around behind Arcueid.
I huddle down on top of a large piece of debris. I put my body against the rock surface and arrange myself into a push-up position.
<Page16>
Green ivy emerges from Arcueid's fingertips and ties me to the debris.
Both of my thighs and my left hand are pinned to it. The only thing left free is my right hand holding the knife.
<Page17>
"Fifty meters to Vlov,
that's the kind of feeling I got from earlier―――"
<Page18>
Arcueid uses both hands to lift up the decoy rubble and the rubble I'm hiding behind.
"Yeah, hold on for four seconds!!"
<Page19>
One ton of bedrock flies through the air.
Three seconds later.
As if to twist the slowdown caused by air resistance with force, the first throw comes flying towards Vlov's head,
and gets shattered by the ice lance before impact.
<Page20>
However, it does not end in vain.
The rubble that was shattered splits into multiple fragments and collides with Vlov.
Despite not dealing damage, it was enough to chip away at his consciousness.
<Page21>
In the meantime, the debris carrying me passes right by him.
<Page22>
I dismantle the debris.
Inertia comes to a stop.
My limbs become free.
I stick to the ground like a lizard.
My body temperature and blood freeze in the moment.
<Page23>
"―――Hah."
I can see Vlov's back.
The distance is four meters. It will be close, but it's not impossible. // ギリギリだが不可能ではない。
<Page24>
Arcueid's third throw holds him in position.
One second passes. One meter to go.
In two more steps, I'll be able to reach his 'line' and sever his life.
<Page25>
However.
It is impossible for a human to cross those two steps.
<Page26>
"――――――"
The room to be able to scream,
and the ability to feel pain was already frozen in place.
Was he aware of my plan, or was it just an automatic interception?
There was a countless number of ice thorns growing around Vlov to greet the attacker.
<Page27>
"―――As the fool you are, you chose the path of safety."
A voice of disappointment reaches me.
Safety. Safety. Safety, huh.
I was thinking about a way to save myself.
Out of concern for me, Arcueid threw my debris a second slower compared to the other ones.
...This was a failure. This was beyond foolish of me.
Something like this was nothing like a surprise attack.
<Page28>
There is no need to wait until I bleed to death.
The pain of the cold wave and my disappointment in myself has brought my heart to a complete stop.
