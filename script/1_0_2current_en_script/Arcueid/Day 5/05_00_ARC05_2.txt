"Well, I can see where you're coming from. 
The flames are definitely a problem, and Vlov himself is powerful enough to be considered worthy of the 'Castle Lord' title.
If I had any knowledge of him at all, I could probably cover some of the difference in strength......."
<Page2>
"Don't you know who he is?" 
You came here to kill the castle lord yourself.
<Page3>
"I don't know any vampires.
One moment we meet and the next moment we are killing each other. It's a rare case where you see each other and part ways, like this. 
"...... Hmm. But he seemed to know you." 
<Page4>
"We've never met. They all just know my identity. The same goes for the other vampires. None of us personally know each other. 
But we do know each other's names and identities. It's only natural that the more powers they possess and the history they have, the more their name becomes known, right?" 
<Page5>
"On the opposite Vlov is a newcomer who hasn't even been named yet. Maybe he's only been an ancestor for about two hundred years?" 
<Page6>
"That word again. What's an ancestor?" 
"Hmm, well, it's kind of like a king of the vampires, I guess.
But that has nothing to do with you, Shiki." 
"It has something to do. What do you mean by 'Castle Lord'?
Is he the master that controls those zombies."
<Page7>
"The castle lords and the ancestors aren't necessarily the same. 
The more powerful the dead apostle, the easier it is for it to become a castle lord, and a castle lord is something like a local ruler. 
The ancestors are higher ranked vampires, they produce even higher rank castle lords." 
<Page8>
"The world of the dead is divided into twenty-seven powers. You can think of it as having twenty-seven countries.” 
The people who rule those countries, or the countries themselves, are the "old" vampires called the "ancestors". They are the ones who stand at the top of the Dead Apostles.
<Page9>
...... twenty-seven countries. And their kings. 
I see, if vampires are alive, they'll have countries and fight for power....
<Page10>
"Wait a minute. Then he is hell of an opponent, isn't he?”
<Page11>
"Well, yes. 
Vlov may still be a novice, but that doesn't make him any less of a walking disaster in the eyes of you humans." 
<Page12>
"The same thing happened at the hotel yesterday. He just came from the first floor to the top floor. He didn't want to kill people, rather, he didn't care about them. 
But his presence is enough to kill a human. Because that flame is like a curse that is generated just by his existence."
<Page13>
"Wha..."
What the hell? 
Killing a human just by being there?
He didn't care about any of those people?
So, the hotel tragedy... 
"Did ...... that happen just because we decided to run to that hotel?"
<Page14>
"Yes. Vlov came because of me. 
...... Arcueid affirmed it. 
She said that even though Vlov killed the people in the hotel, she was the one who invited the disaster. 
<Page15>
".........." 
"It's easy to denounce Arcueid and say, "It's your fault. As a human being, it's right to say that. She doesn't give a damn about human life. In that respect, she's a monster just like Vlov.
It's just that....... Who was it due to which Arcueid had to flee to that hotel?
<Page16>
'It's my fault'.....?
Yeah, that's right. 
The people of the hotel were also caught up in the disaster that was Vlov...
And that Arcueid is in this mess. 
It's all my fault for making her kill...
<Page17>
"Shiki. Don't make the same mistake again. 
It would be natural for the weaker creatures to disappear. 
Their deaths are the fault of the entire human species, which has somehow evolved to be unable to defend itself. 
If a person kills another person, that is certainly a crime in human society. But this is a part of natural selection between humans and non-humans. It would be arrogant to think that you are personally responsible.” 
<Page18>
"Arrogant, am I ......the one being arrogant ......?" 
<Page19>
"Yes. If you're a human representative, that's fine. 
Okay, let's talk about a story about the mountains.
There was a community of predators there. Their diet included humans. Then one day, the humans, who were completely unaware of this fact, came and wiped out all of them for their own purposes.
<Page20>
Which one of them is to blame in this case?" 
The ones who couldn't defend themselves against the humans? 
Or the humans who killed them all?" 
<Page21>
"That's..." 
The thoughts of self-loathing stop. 
Arcueid's analogy was not out of concern for me. Rather, it was an expression of disdain. 
The place of sin. The weight of life. The hypocrisy of people who cannot help but reflect on these things is being denounced.
<Page22>
...... That is what she is saying. 
She said that neither man nor beast is innocent. 
But in this natural world. 
A species that cannot preserve its own life is absolutely evil. 
<Page23>
"......but here." 
It's a human society. It's a human city. 
I'm not talking about humans being too weak or vampires being too strong. 
<Page24>
A city is a human defense mechanism that protects the individuals in a group because it is difficult to live alone. 
I should be held accountable for inviting vampires into this place.
<Page25>
"...... Yes. I guess I was wrong, too. 
You're definitely not the kind of person who can be a killer."
"What is that supposed to mean? 
You think I'm naive?" 
<Page26>
"There's a problem before that. So let's be clear here. 
Shiki, what are you going to do from now? 
Fight the vampires? Or run away? 
Choose your path. I'm not going to force you anymore. You have fulfilled your promise to watch over me yesterday."
<Page27>
What am I going to do...? 
That's obvious---
<Page28>
"But you have to be prepared. Fighting vampires means stepping outside the boundaries of humanity. 
No matter how many humans are sacrificed, if you can't see it as something that has nothing to do with you, you will surely fail. 
If you think that's wrong, go back to normal, the way you were yesterday. Because that correct way for the human species to live. 
<Page29>
.....Arcueid's gaze stung.
