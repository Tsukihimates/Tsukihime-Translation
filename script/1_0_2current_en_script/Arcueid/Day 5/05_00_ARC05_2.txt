"Well, I can see where you're coming from. 
The flames are definitely a problem, and Vlov himself is powerful enough to be considered worty of the 'Castle Lord' title.
If I had any knowledge on him at all, I could probably mitigate some of the power difference..."
<Page2>
"Don't you know who he is?" 
You came here to kill the castle lord yourself.
<Page3>
"I don't know any vampires."
The moment I meet one, next minute I'm killing them. It's a special case where you see each other and then break up, like this. 
"...... Hmm. But he seemed to know you." 
<Page4>
"We've never met. They all just know my identity. The same goes for the other vampires. Basically, none of us personally know each other. 
But we do know each other's names and identities. It's only natural that the more powers they possess and the history they have , the more their name becomes known, right?" 
<Page5>
"I guess Vlov is the opposite, a newcomer who hasn't even been named yet. Maybe he's only been an ancestor for about two hundred years?" 
<Page6>
"That word again. What's an ancestor?" 
"Hmm, well, he's kind of like a king of the vampires, I guess."
“It's none of your business." 
"It is my business. What do you mean, is he a castle lord? 
"He's the master of those zombies."
<Page7>
"The castle lords and the ancestors aren't necessarily the same. 
The more powerful the dead apostle, the easier it is for it become a castle lord, and a castle lord is something like a local ruler. 
The ancestors are higher ranked vampires, they produce...the lords" 
<Page8>
"The world of the dead is divided into twenty-seven powers. You can think of it as having twenty-seven countries.” 
The vampires who rule a country, are the "old" vampires called the "ancestors". These are the ones who stand at the top of the dead apostles. 
<Page9>
...... twenty-seven countries. And their kings. 
I see, if vampires are still alive, they'll have countries and fight for power....... 
<Page10>
"Wait a minute. That's a hell of an opponent, isn't it?”
<Page11>
"Well, yes. 
Vlov may still be a novice, but that doesn't make him any less of a walking disaster in the eyes of you humans." 
<Page12>
"The same thing happened at the hotel yesterday. He just came from the first floor to the top floor. He didn't want to kill people, rather, he didn't care about them. 
But his presence is enough to kill a human. Because that flame is like a curse that is generated just by his existence."
<Page13>
"Wha..."
What the hell? 
Killing a human just by being there?
He didn't care any of those people?
So, the hotel tragedy... 
"Did ...... that happen just because we decided to run away to that hotel?"
<Page14>
"Yes. Vlov came because of me. 
...... Arcueid affirmed it. 
She said that even though Vlov killed the people in the hotel, she was the one who brought the disaster. 
<Page15>
"..............., huh." 
"It's easy to denounce Arcueid and say, "It's your fault. As a human being, it's right to say that. She doesn't give a damn about human life. In that respect, she's a monster just like Vlov.
It's just that....... Who was it due to which Arcueid had to flee to that hotel?
<Page16>
"It's my own fault.....?"
Yeah, you're absolutely right. 
The people of the hotel were also caught up in the disaster that was Vlov...
And that Arcueid is in this mess. 
It's all my fault for killing her... 
<Page17>
"Shiki. Don't make the same mistake again. 
It would be natural for the weaker creatures to disappear. 
Their deaths are the fault of the entire human species, which has somehow evolved to be unable to defend itself. 
If a person kills another person, that is certainly a crime in human society. But this is a part of natural selection between humans and non-humans. It would be arrogant to think that you are personally responsible.” 
<Page18>
"Arrogant, am I ...... the one being arrogant ......?" 
<Page19>
"Yes. If you're a human representative, that's fine. 
For example, about the mountains. 
There was a community of carnivores there. Their diet included humans. One day, the humans, who were completely unaware of this fact, came and annihilated them all for their own purposes. 
<Page20>
Which one of them is to blame in this case?" 
The ones who couldn't defend themselves against the humans? 
Or the people who killed them all?" 
<Page21>
"It's..." 
The thoughts of self-loathing stop. 
Arcueid's parable was not one of concern for me. Rather, it was an expression of contempt. 
The place of sin. The weight of life. It denounces the hypocrisy of people who cannot help but reflect on these things. 
<Page22>
...... That is what she is saying. 
She said that neither man nor beast is innocent. 
But in this natural world. 
A species that cannot sustain its own life is absolutely evil. 
<Page23>
"......but here..." 
It's a human society. It's a human city. 
I'm not talking about humans being too weak or vampires being too strong. 
<Page24>
A city is a human defense mechanism that protects the individuals in a group because it is difficult to live alone. 
I should be held accountable for inviting vampires into my life. 
<Page25>
"...... Yes. I guess I was wrong, too. 
You're certainly not the kind of person who can be a killer." 
"What the hell is up with the way you said that. 
You think I'm naive?" 
<Page26>
"There's a problem before that. So let's be clear here. 
Shiki, what are you going to do from now? 
Fight the vampires? Or run away? 
Choose your path. I'm not going to force you anymore. Your promise to watch over me was fulfilled yesterday."
<Page27>
What am I going to do...? 
No, that's not... 
<Page28>
"But you have to be prepared. Fighting vampires means stepping outside the boundaries of humanity. 
No matter how many humans are sacrificed, if you can't see it as something that has nothing to do with you, you will surely fail. 
If you think that's wrong, go back to normal, the way you were yesterday. Because that correct way for the human species to live. 
<Page29>
.....Arcueid's gaze stung.
