"Well, I can understand where you're coming from.
These flames are definitely a problem, and Vlov himself is powerful enough to be considered worthy of the title 'Castle Lord'.
If I had even a little bit of knowledge of him, I could probably cover some of the differences in strength..."
<Page2>
"Are you telling me that you don't know who he is?"
Even though you came all the way here to kill this 'Castle Lord'?
<Page3>
"I'm not acquainted with any vampires.
Any time vampires meet, mortal combat will ensue. Cases like this where vampires part ways after meeting each other are incredibly rare."
"...Hmm. But it seemed like he knew a lot about you."
<Page4>
"We've never met. I'm well known among vampires, so he just happens to know who I am. The same goes for the other vampires, none of us are particularly well-acquainted.
But we do know each other's names and identities. It's only natural that the more power we possess and the longer our histories, the more our names become known, right?"
<Page5>
"But Vlov is the opposite. He is a newcomer who hasn't even been inscribed yet. I would say that he's only been an Ancestor for around 200 years or so."
<Page6>
"There's that word again. What do you mean by the word 'Ancestor'?"
"Hmm, well, it's kind of like a king among vampires, I guess.
It has nothing to do with you, Shiki."
"But it does. This has to do with that 'Castle Lord' guy, right?
The one that's controlling those zombies or something."
<Page7>
"Castle Lords and Ancestors are not necessarily the same.
The more powerful a Dead Apostle is, the easier it is for them to become a Castle Lord, which is something more like a local ruler.
Ancestors are something above that... They're a higher class of vampire that can produce these feudal lords."
<Page8>
"The world of Dead Apostles is divided into twenty-seven powers. You can think of it as twenty-seven different countries.
Those who rule those countries, or form those countries themselves, are the ancient vampires known as 'Ancestors'. They are the ones who stand on top of the Dead Apostles."
<Page9>
...Twenty-seven countries and their kings.
I see. If there are vampires then it follows that they would have countries and fight each other for power... wait.
<Page10>
"Hold on. Then doesn't that make him an extremely powerful opponent!?"
<Page11>
"Well, you could say that.
Vlov may still be a novice, but that doesn't make him any less of a walking disaster in the eyes of you humans."
<Page12>
"Consider the hotel yesterday. All he did was move from the first floor to the top floor. He didn't have any intention to kill anybody, it didn't even cross his mind.
But his presence is enough to kill a human. That flame is like a curse that gets generated through his existence alone."
<Page13>
"Wha―――"
What the hell?
Killing humans just by existing?
Humans don't matter to him?
Then that hotel tragedy...
"...Did all of that happen... because we fled to the hotel...?"
<Page14>
"Yes. Vlov came because that's where I was."
...Arcueid confirms it.
Although Vlov was the one that killed those people, we were the ones that caused that disaster.
<Page15>
"........"
It would be easy to just blame it all on Arcueid. That would be the right thing to do as a human being. After all, she doesn't give a damn about human life. In that way, she's a monster just like Vlov.
It's just that... who was responsible for Arcueid fleeing to that hotel in the first place?
<Page16>
'Is it my fault'...?
Yeah, that's exactly right.
The people in the hotel that got caught up in the disaster.
Arcueid going through that suffering.
All of the blame lies on me, the one who killed her―――
<Page17>
"Shiki. Don't make the same mistake twice.
The extinguishing of weaker creatures is the natural way of things.
Their deaths are the fault of the entire human race, which has somehow evolved to the point of being unable to defend themselves.
If a person kills another person, that is certainly a crime in human society. But this is a part of natural selection between humans and non-humans. It would be arrogant to hold yourself personally responsible."
<Page18>
"Me? ...Arrogant...?"
<Page19>
"Yes. Although, it might be a different story if you were some representative of humanity.
Consider this story for example,
Suppose there was a community of carnivores in the remote mountains. Their diet also included humans. Then one day, humans, completely unaware of that fact, came and wiped them all out for their own purposes."
<Page20>
"In this case, who do you say the blame lies with?
The carnivores who couldn't defend themselves against the humans?
Or the humans who slaughtered them all?"
<Page21>
"―――That's―――"
My thoughts of self-loathing come to a halt.
Arcueid made an analogy not out of concern for me, but rather, as an expression of disdain.
The place of sin. The weight of a life. She's denouncing the hypocrisy of <the people|  m e  > who cannot help but reflect on these things.
<Page22>
...That's what she was trying to say.
She said that neither man nor beast is innocent.
But in the world of nature,
a species that cannot preserve its own life is an absolute evil.
<Page23>
"...But, this is..."
This is a society of humans. A city of humans.
This is not a matter of humans being too weak or vampires being too strong.
<Page24>
Cities are a human defense mechanism to protect the individuals as a group because it's too difficult to live alone.
Whether or not I should be responsible for summoning that vampire is something that definitely needs to be questioned―――
<Page25>
"...Yeah. I guess I was wrong as well.
You are certainly not the kind of person who can be a killer."
"...What is that supposed to mean?
Are you telling me that I'm soft?"
<Page26>
"That's not the issue at hand. Let me make it clear for you.
Shiki, what are you going to do from now on?
Are you going to fight that vampire? Or are you going to run away?
Choose the path you want. I won't force you anymore. You fulfilled your promise to watch over me yesterday."
<Page27>
What am I... going to do...?
That's obvious―――
<Page28>
"But you have to be prepared. To fight a vampire is to step outside the boundaries of humanity.
No matter how many humans are sacrificed, you need to be able to detach yourself. Otherwise, you will fail without a doubt.
If you think that is wrong, then go back to the normal life you lead before yesterday. Because that's the best way for a human to live."
<Page29>
...Arcueid's gaze pierces into me.
