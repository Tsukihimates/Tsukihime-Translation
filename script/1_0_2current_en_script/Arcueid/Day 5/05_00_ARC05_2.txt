"Well, I can see where you're coming from. 
The flames are definitely a nuisance, and Vlov himself is powerful enough to be considered worty of the 'Castle Lord' title.
If I had any knowledge on him at all, I could probably overturn some of the power difference..."
<Page2>
"Don't you know who he is?" 
You came here to kill the castle lord yourself.
<Page3>
"I don't know any vampires."
The moment I meet one, next minute I'm killing them. It's a special case where you see each other and then break up, like this. 
"...... Hmm. But he seemed to know you." 
<Page4>
"We've never met. I'm known to all the vampires, so they just know me. The same goes for the other vampires. Basically, we don't know each other. 
But we do know each other's names and identities. It's only natural that more the history and more the unique abilities an individual possesses, the more their name becomes known, right?" 
<Page5>
"I guess Vlov is the opposite, a newcomer who hasn't even been named yet. Maybe he's been an ancestor for two hundred years?" 
<Page6>
"That word again. What's an ancestor?" 
"Hmm, well, he's kind of the king of the vampires, I guess. 
“It's something that is none of Shiki's business." 
"But It has something to do with me. What do you mean, he's the lord of the castle? 
“He's the master of those zombies." 
<Page7>
"The lord of the castle and the founder are not necessarily the same. 
The more powerful the dead, the easier it is to become a lord of a castle, and a lord of a castle is like a local lord. 
The ancestors are even higher vampires, producing ...... the lords" 
<Page8>
"The world of the dead is divided into twenty-seven powers. You can think of it as having twenty-seven countries.” 
The vampires who rule the country, or even the country itself, are the "old" vampires called the "ancestors. These are the ones who stand at the top of the mortals. 
<Page9>
...... twenty-seven countries. And their kings. 
I see, if vampires are still alive, they'll have countries and fight for power. ...... 
<Page10>
"Wait a minute. That's a hell of an opponent, isn't it?”
<Page11>
"Well, yes. 
Vlov may still be a novice, but that doesn't make him any less of a disaster in the eyes of you humans." 
<Page12>
"The same thing happened at the hotel yesterday. He just came from the first floor to the top floor. He didn't want to kill people, rather, he didn't really care about them. 
But just that is enough to kill a human. Because that flame is like a curse that is generated just by that guy's presence." 
<Page13>
"No..." 
What the hell is that? 
Killing a human just for being here? 
He didn't care about people? 
So, the hotel tragedy... 
"Did ...... this happen because we ran away to a hotel?" 
<Page14>
"Yes. Vlov came because of me. 
...... Arcueid affirmed it. 
She said that even though Vlov killed the people in the hotel, she was the one who brought the disaster. 
<Page15>
"..............., huh." 
"It's easy to denounce Arcueid and say, "It's your fault. As a human being, it's right. She doesn't give a damn about human life. In that respect, she is a monster just like Vlov. 
It's just that....... Who was it that gave Arcueid the reason to flee to the hotel? 
<Page16>
"It's your own fault." ......? 
Yeah, you're absolutely right. 
The people of the hotel were also caught up in the disaster that was Vlov.. 
And that Arcueid is in this mess. 
It's all my fault for killing her... 
<Page17>
"Shiki. Don't make the same mistake again. 
It would be natural for the weaker creatures to disappear. 
Their deaths are the fault of the entire human species, which has somehow evolved to be unable to defend itself. 
If a person kills another person, that is certainly a crime in human society. But this is a part of natural selection between humans and non-humans. It would be arrogant to think that you are personally responsible.” 
<Page18>
"Arrogant, am I ...... the one being arrogant ......?" 
<Page19>
"Yes. If you're a human representative, that's fine. 
Good, for example, about the mountains. 
There was a community of carnivores there. Their diet included humans. One day, the humans, who were completely unaware of this fact, came and annihilated them all for their own purposes. 
<Page20>
Which one of them is to blame in this case?" 
The ones who couldn't defend themselves against the humans? 
Or the person who killed them all?" 
<Page21>
"It's..." 
The thoughts of self-loathin stop. 
Arcueid's parable was not one of concern for me. Rather, it was an expression of contempt. 
The place of sin. The weight of life. It denounces the hypocrisy of people who cannot help but reflect on these things. 
<Page22>
...... That is what she is saying. 
She said that neither man nor beast is innocent. 
But in this natural world. 
A species that cannot sustain its own life is absolutely evil. 
<Page23>
"......, but here..." 
It's a human society. It's a human city. 
I'm not talking about humans being too weak or vampires being too strong. 
<Page24>
A city is a human defense mechanism that protects the individual in a group because it is difficult to live alone. 
I should be held accountable for inviting vampires into my life. 
<Page25>
"...... Yes. I guess I was wrong, too. 
You're certainly not the kind of person who can be a killer." 
"What the hell is up with the way you said that. 
You think I'm naive?" 
<Page26>
"There's a problem before that. So let's be clear here. 
Shiki, what are you going to do from now? 
Fight the vampires? Or run away? 
Take your pick. I'm not going to force you anymore. Your promise to watch over me was fulfilled yesterday, one day ago."
<Page27>
What are you going to do, because ......? 
No, that's not... 
<Page28>
"But you have to be prepared. Fighting vampires means stepping outside the boundaries of humanity. 
No matter how many humans are sacrificed, if you can't see it as something that has nothing to do with you, you will surely go bankrupt. 
If you think that's wrong, go back to the way you were yesterday. Because that is the most correct way for the human species to be. 
<Page29>
...... Arcueid's gaze stung.
