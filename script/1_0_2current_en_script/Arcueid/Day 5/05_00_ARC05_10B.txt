A few hours have passed since the massive fire in front of the station.
When it first broke out, firefighters on the scene reported it would take two days to extinguish due to the intensity of the blaze, but it slowed down before midnight and was extinguished soon after.
'It went out by itself, as though it were a living thing', said a policeman at the scene.

"The traffic restrictions from here up to Route 305 will be lifted by five o'clock tomorrow morning.
The highways lifted their restrictions a little while ago.
We have also disposed of any remaining traces of the Dead Apostles that were at the scene.
Shall we head to the Metropolitan Police Department, Mario-sama?"
<Page3>
"I don't want to go, but I have no choice. It's not every day that you get a commotion of this magnitude, even back home.
The old man's name alone won't be enough to settle this. I need to go out and show some good faith every once in a while."
<Page4>
"In that case, allow me to accompany you.
Would you like to delegate command of the scene to the Executors as usual?"
<Page5>
"Ah, you mean those guys that were investigating undercover for whatever reason.
They were a two-man cell, right? Call the lower rank one to my hotel and make her stand by. We'll use them if we have to.
Have the burial agency return back to the homeland as soon as possible. If we nudge Seonator a bit, he'll be on the move immediately."
<Page6>
"As you command. I will send a letter of protest to Priest Noi under the name of Laurentis-sama."
"Right. Our work here is almost finished.
It doesn't really matter who's in charge of cleaning up the scene, but...
Hey, Ando!"
<Page7>
"Hey, did you call me, young master?
Man, today is not my lucky day. It'd be far-fetched to just write this off as some kind of gas explosion. Should we get some terrorist organization to make a statement?"
<Page8>
"No need for that. We'll leave the external affairs to the owner of this area. After all, he'll start boasting if we hit him enough.//is that really the meaning of 叩けばホコリが出る?
Our job is to retrieve the things that are not supposed to be here. We've wiped out most traces of the Dead Apostles, but there's still work to be done handling the victims. That's your job now."//オマエ、やっとけ is a bit brusque. //ruby dots <こ|・><こ|・><の|・><持|・><ち|・><主|・>
<Page9>
"Sure, no prob...# wait, hold on, that battalion that you always bring around still hasn't entered this country, right?
Don't tell me it's just me? You want me to check all those dead bodies? And find out if they've been bitten or not?"
<Page10>
"You're not just finding out. If they're alive, send them to the church. If they're dead, kill them again."
<Page11>
"Ack. You don't want to do that sort of dirty work, so you employed someone like me to do it, didn't you?"
"Be quick. I'll make sure that the morgue is cleared of people. You should be able to finish by dawn."
<Page12>
"Well, it's just a job where I have to pull the trigger on some stationary targets. That is, if I completely ignore the emotional toll, right?"
<Page13>
"Bring the car around, Karius.# We're going to visit the public office."//Presumably this is the met police office referenced above. Maybe reword, public office is kinda vague.
"Yes, right away.
Are there any other arrangements that need to be made? For a contamination of this scale, I can request for some immediate assistance―"
<Page14>
"That won't be necessary. Or rather, don't you ever report this. We'll handle this matter right here and now.
We'll be gathering intel for a while. But we're on the side of justice, so we can't afford any unnecessary casualties.
Who is the enemy and who is in the way―――that's the real question."
<Page15>
[Work in progress]"...I guess we'll just have to run." // 【制作中】「......逃げるしか、ないのか。」 ...why is this here?
