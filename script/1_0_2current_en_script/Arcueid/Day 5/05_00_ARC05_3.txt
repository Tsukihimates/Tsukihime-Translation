"I see. Then I won't say anything.
I'm glad you're fighting with me. You can "kill" Vlov with a single blow without any problem."
<Page2>
"...No, I can' t do that.
It's too hot around him to get close.
And before that, how are we going to find him?"
<Page3>
"Finding him...you're really extreme Shiki, aren't you? If you've decided not to run, then why don't you go on the offensive?"
"I'm extreme!? I don't want to hear it from you, the incarnation of extremism."
<Page4>
"I'm just more focused on efficiency.
...Well, fine. I'll tell you what, it's going to be an endurance battle from here on out.
The most reliable strategy is to escape until my strength returns.
In another three days, my strength will be restored to about 30% of its original level. With that much power, I can defeat Vlov on my own."
<Page5>
"Three days?.....No, but..."
"Yes. For those three days, Vlov is on the loose. He'll go underground and replenish his blood supply from humans...no, that's not all. From the looks of him, he might be roaming the streets at night.
He's not in his right mind. If he doesn't hide himself, the church will come after him, or maybe he doesn't care about that."
<Page6>
"You can't do that. He's a fire-breathing monster. You can't leave him alone for even a day!"
<Page7>
"Then we'll have to find Vlov during the day and kill him.
But I'm against it. I have a rough idea of where he is, but there's nothing more cautious than a sleeping Dead Apostle. It's more likely that we'll take the hit instead."
<Page8>
"No way. You've got a good idea of where he is, but you're just gonna let him go...?"
"Yeah. I told you, it's none of my business how many humans fall prey to Vlov."
<Page9>
......I'm speechless.
I can see where Arcueid is coming from.
Safety measures...no, if I want to be safe, I should wait for Arcueid to recover from her wounds and regain her strength for now.
<Page10>
...But the price of that is that the more time we waste here, the more casualties there will be.
I'm going to――――
C:>...Find Vlov now.
C:>...At least, stay here until nightfall.
