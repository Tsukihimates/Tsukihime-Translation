We head to the park just after nine o'clock in the evening.
<Page2>
"This is very important, so maybe I should explain it one more time.
Long-lived Dead Apostles have 'supernatural abilities' that weaponize their very existence.
In addition to the basic abilities of vampires, these individuals can drink blood in order to gain something similar to a 'special curse'."
<Page3>
"Vlov is a Dead Apostle who has reached that stage.
In order to defeat Dead Apostles, you must overcome their supernatural ability.
Humans have no way to win as long as they do not possess the means to erase those flames. That is why, until I go and break Vlov's curse, you need to stay away from him."// em-dash turned to comma
<Page4>
The plan itself is quite simple.
Arcueid will stay here and lure Vlov out.
Apparently, vampires can fully pinpoint each other's location if they don't hide their biological wavelength or something like that.
<Page5>
It appears that Vlov isn't the type to hide his wavelength.
I don't know if it's because he doesn't care or if he is simply unable to.
<Page6>
In fact, if Vlov were to approach us, Arcueid would be able to detect him in advance.
Arcueid on the other hand has always suppressed her wavelength, and is now releasing it in order to provoke Vlov.
<Page7>
In other words, it's like a light trap.
All we have to do is wait for a moth-like Vlov to be lured in by the light that is Arcueid.
<Page8>
After that, the rest will go as planned.
I'll watch the fight closely while hiding in the bushes.
When Arcueid binds Vlov with her chains, I'll jump out of the shadows,
and cut the 'lines' on Vlov.
<Page9>
Arcueid shows no sign of nervousness.
She just blankly stares at the sky in boredom.
<Page10>
"........."
But the same does not go for me.
Without realizing it, I tightly grip the knife concealed in my pocket.
<Page11>
...I know.
There are a few uncertainties in this strategy.
<Page12>
For one, there is the possibility that Vlov will notice me hiding.
Although Arcueid said that the possibility of this happening is extremely low, in the end, it's still not zero.
If that happens, there is no guaranteeing my safety. There is a risk that I will be burned without being able to do anything, just like the people in the hotel.
<Page13>
But that's okay.
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
However, there's another problem.
That is, if Arcueid is unable to restrain Vlov... In other words, the case where Vlov takes her down.
<Page14>
...In that scenario, I'd be the only one left.
Stopping Vlov and saving Arcueid; it would all depend on this single knife.
<Page15>
That vampire...
Can I really go against his cursed flames by myself?
<Page16>
My limbs tremble at the thought of it.
My fingers clench the handle of the knife so hard it hurts.
...An indescribable fear.
I cannot figure out what is causing this feeling―――
<Page17>
"Are you scared, Shiki?"
Before I know it, Arcueid is standing right in front of me.
...How pathetic. She must have noticed that I'm trembling.
<Page18>
"Yeah, I'm scared shitless. Just the thought of that vampire getting any closer makes me want to cry."
"But Shiki, you're not crying."
"That's because I'm holding it in. Try to understand, idiot."
<Page19>
She really is insensitive. It would be nice if she could understand me, even if just a little.
<Page20>
"........."
However.
I'm not sure exactly what she objects to, but it looks like Arcueid is not pleased with what I just said.
<Page21>
"In case you didn't know, I am also a vampire like him."
"Yeah. I know. I've heard it a million times."
<Page22>
"Like I said, I'm also a vampire. Shouldn't you be afraid of me as well?
Based on what you've said so far, I thought you would have come to think of me as a disgusting monster."
"Huh?"
<Page23>
Now that she points it out, I'm a little surprised.
It's just like she says... but...
<Page24>
"But you're kind of different. After all, you've never even drunk blood before. In that case, it's fine. Whether you're a vampire or whatever else, as long as you don't lay a hand on any of us, it's okay."
<Page25>
"I see. That's one way of thinking about it."
Whether she understood or not, Arcueid makes a noncommittal sound and drops the topic.
<Page26>
The hands of the clock point toward ten.
According to Arcueid, this is when vampires are most active.
<Page27>
...Vlov will come to the surface.
I don't know where his stronghold is, but I'm sure that once he wakes up, Vlov will sense Arcueid's presence and head toward this park.
<Page28>
"――――――Is he serious?"
Arcueid's tone changes.
With a mutter of intense disgust, she glares north... in the direction of the station.
<Page29>
"Arcueid...?"
"I don't believe this―――is that guy really a member of the Ancestors?"
<Page30>
I turn to follow Arcueid's gaze.
Is that... smoke?
There is a pillar of smoke rising on the horizon.
There must be a fire somewhe―――no, hold on.
A fire...!?//ruby dots <火|・><災|・>
<Page31>
"Arcueid, don't tell me that's...!?"
"It's Vlov. He's attacking people indiscriminately."
<Page32>
"He's insane, I was too optimistic. That guy is no different from an undead. He's just a beast that feeds on the people in front of him when he lacks blood. It's as if he's completely unable to grasp the rules of human beings in this era―――of civilized society."
<Page33>
A loud explosion can be heard in the distance.
The black smoke rising into the night sky continues to gain volume. // volume is a bit of artistic liberty - 夜空に立ち上る黒煙は勢いを増していく。
This is bad. This can't even be compared to what happened at the hotel. If he appears in such a crowded downtown area, the number of casualties will be orders of magnitude higher!
<Page34>
"Arcueid...!"
"I know. We need to hurry, Shiki."
<Page35>
I start running toward the station.
What the hell is going on over there...!?
