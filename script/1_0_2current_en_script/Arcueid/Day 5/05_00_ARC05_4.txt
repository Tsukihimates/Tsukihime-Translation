We move to the park just as the night turns past nine o'clock.
<Page2>
"This is very important, so maybe I should explain it one more time.
Dead Apostles that have lived long enough gain weapons in the form of 'supernatural abilities' as a result of their existence.
In addition to the basic abilities of vampires, these individuals can drink blood in order to gain something similar to a 'special curse'."
<Page3>
"Vlov is a Dead Apostle that has reached that stage.
In order to defeat Dead Apostles, we have to destroy their supernatural abilities.
Humans have no way to win as long as they do not possess the means to erase those flames. That is why――― until I go and break Vlov's curse, you need to stay away from him."
<Page4>
The plan itself is quite simple.
Arcueid will stay here and lure Vlov out.
Apparently vampires can fully pinpoint each other's location if they don't hide their biological wavelength or something like that.
<Page5>
It appears that Vlov isn't the type to hide his wavelength.
I don't know if it's because he doesn't care or if he is simply unable to.
<Page6>
As a matter of fact, if Vlov were to get close, then Arcueid would be able to detect him in advance.
Arcueid on the other hand has always suppressed her wavelength, and is now releasing it in order to provoke Vlov.
<Page7>
In other words, it's like a light trap.
All we have to do is wait for a moth like Vlov to be lured by the light that is Arcueid.
<Page8>
After that, the rest will go as planned.
I'll watch the fight closely while hiding in the bushes.
And when Arcueid binds Vlov with her chains, I'll jump out of the shadows,
and cut the 'lines' on Vlov.
<Page9>
Arcueid shows no sign of nervousness.
She just blankly stares at the sky in boredom.
<Page10>
"........."
But the same does not go for me.
Without realizing it, I tightly grip the knife concealed in my pocket.
<Page11>
...I know.
There are a few uncertainties in this strategy.
<Page12>
For one, there is the possibility that Vlov will notice me hiding.
Although Arcueid said that the possibility of this happening is extremely low, in the end, it's still not zero.
If that happens, there is no guarantee for my safety. There is a risk that I will be burned without being able to do anything, just like at the hotel.
<Page13>
But that's okay.
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
However, there is another problem.
That is when Arcueid is unable to restrain Vlov... In other words, the case where Vlov takes her down.
<Page14>
...In that scenario, there would be no one else but me.
It will be up to this single knife to both stop Vlov and save Arcueid.
<Page15>
That vampire.
Can I really go against those cursed flames by myself...?
<Page16>
My limbs tremble at the thought of it.
My fingers clench the handle of the knife so hard that I begin to feel pain.
...A fear that cannot be described.
I cannot figure out what is causing this feeling―――
<Page17>
"Are you scared, Shiki?"
Before I know it, Arcueid is standing right in front of me.
...How pathetic. She must have noticed that I am trembling.
<Page18>
"Yeah, I'm scared as shit. Just the thought of that vampire getting closer makes me want to cry."
"But Shiki, you're not crying."
"That's because I'm holding it in. Try to understand, idiot."
<Page19>
She really is insensitive. It would be nice if she could understand me even if just a little.
<Page20>
"......"
However.
I don't know if something is off, but it looks like Arcueid is not pleased with what I just said.
<Page21>
"In case you didn't know, I am also a vampire like him."
"Yeah. I know. I've heard it a million times."
<Page22>
"And so I'm asking you, why you are not afraid of me?
Based on what you've said so far, I thought that you see me as some disgusting creature."
"Huh?"
<Page23>
... I get a little surprised when she points it out.
It's just like she says... but...
<Page24>
"But you're kind of different. After all, you've never even drank blood before. In that case, it's fine. Whether you're a vampire or whatever else, as long as you don't lay a hand on anyone of us, then it's okay."
<Page25>
"I see. That's one way of thinking about it."
Whether she understood or not, Arcueid acts as if it is a completely unrelated matter.
<Page26>
The hands of the clock point towards ten o'clock.
According to Arcueid, this is when vampires are most active.
<Page27>
... Vlov will come to the surface.
I don't know where his stronghold is, but I'm sure after being awoken, Vlov will sense Arcueid's presence and head towards this park.
<Page28>
"―――――― Is he serious?"
Arcueid's tone changes.
With a mutter of intense disgust, she glares in the direction... of the north station.
<Page29>
"Arcueid...?"
"I don't believe this――― is that guy really a member of the Ancestors?"
<Page30>
I turn my gaze in the direction where Arcueid is looking.
Is that... smoke?
There is smoke rising in the air.
There must be a fire incident somewhe――― No, hold on.
A fire...!?
<Page31>
"Arcueid, don't tell me that's...!?"
"It's Vlov. He's indiscriminately attacking people."
<Page32>
"He's insane, I was too optimistic. That guy is no different from an undead. He's just a beast that feeds on people in front of him when he lacks blood. This society――― It's as if he's completely unable to grasp the rules of humans in this generation."
<Page33>
A loud explosion can be heard in the distance.
The black smoke rising into the night sky continues to gain momentum.
This is bad. This is nothing compared to what happened at the hotel. If he appears in such a crowded downtown area, the casualties will be in an entirely different league...!
<Page34>
"Arcueid...!"
"I know. We need to hurry, Shiki."
<Page35>
I start running towards the station.
What the hell is going on over there...!?
