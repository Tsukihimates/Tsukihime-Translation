But I've never done anything like this before.
I said first aid, but all I could think of was antiseptic, gauze to seal the wound, bandages, and painkillers.
The other thing is nutrition. She needs to get some nutrition.
<Page2>
Fortunately, I have a lot of money.
Even if it's an amateur idea, it's better to have something extra than not having something. You never know what might help.
Believing that, I bought everything I could think of.
<Page3>
"Hey wait, that tickles!"
"..............."
<Page4>
Ignoring the tension in her voice, I applied the gauze as delicately as I could.
The wound on Arcueid's abdomen wasn't that big.
<Page5>
...... No, a horizontal four-centimeter-deep wound would be fatal for any human, but, according to Arcueid---
"It's not a big deal at all!"
Oh well.
<Page6>
Apparently, the internal organs will heal on their own. This was so out of the ordinary that I didn't want to talk about it.
The bleeding had stopped and all that was left to do was to close the wound, but from that point on, things didn't go as planned.
<Page7>
Although it might be a waste of time for such a large wound, I applied some antiseptic to it to prevent bacterial infection.
I was afraid that she would go crazy because it was soaking, but she didn't budge at all. Rather...
"Hmm? Did you just do something?"
Is she insensitive.....no, she's sturdy.
<Page8>
"......All right."
I put gauze on the wound and carefully wrapped a bandage around it.
"Ahaha, stop it, you're too good at that Shiki!"
<Page9>
Apparently this was funny for Arcueid.
The bandage seemed to tickle her, even though the antiseptic didn't even faze her.
<Page10>
"............"
I Ignore her and fasten the bandage on with a pin. Wounds are said to stop bleeding if you bind them a bit tighter, so I give it a final squeeze.
"......Ouch. Now I'm deducting points, Shiki."
<Page11>
"..............."
Phew. Well, that's all I can do for now.
Incidentally, I had closed the curtains again out of concern for Arcueid.
<Page12>
"...... Well. I tried to follow the instructions, but lets see.
Can you move, Arcueid?"
<Page13>
Yeah, it feels fine to move. But it's still a mess on the inside, so I won't be able to move around properly."
<Page14>
"I see. Well, you'll have to deal with that on your end.
I specialize in cutting, healing is not my domain."
I move away from Arcueid and sit down beside the wall.
<Page15>
"You can go to sleep now, good night.
 You'll get better as soon as you sleep and get your strength back, right?　I'll keep an eye on you so just sleep quietly."
<Page16>
"No, sleep will not heal my wounds. As you said, sleep can only heal fatigue.
　In my case, my strength recovers purely with the passage of time. By night, I'll be able to recover enough to move normally."
<Page17>
That said, it's still not good for my mental health to see her in pain like that.
<Page18>
"Just go to sleep.
You look like you're in pain just by talking to me."
"But since you are awake...
I don't want to sleep either."
<Page19>
Arcueid sits upright on the bed.
She's in full-on chatter mode.
"Oh C'mon."
I don't have a choice.
I've got some questions I need to ask her aswell, so I'll just talk to her a bit.
<Page20>
"Arcueid. Can I ask you about the hotel yesterday?"
".....Oh well, I guess if it's you and me this sort of conversation is bound to happen."
<Page21>
"Yesterday that guy ....you called him "Vlov", but what is he actually?
I know he's a vampire. He was wearing that strange outfit and that he was after you. But....
<Page22>
Those blue flames that filled the hallway and burned everyone but the humans. It was too far from the image of a vampire.
<Page23>
 "These 4 lines need to be translated directly

 These 4 lines need to be translated directly"
<Page24>
"Yeah.......That fire was abnormal from your point of view as well right? Is he stronger than you?"
....... Arcueid gave a blunt sigh.
<Page25>
"Well you see, I was killed by someone, and now I'm down to the level of having trouble fighting those second-rate mortals.
If you were to compare me with Vlov right now, he is slightly more powerful.
<Page26>
"......I see.
So if you were completely normal, could you manage to defeat someone like him?"
<Page27>
"What do you mean, it'll be completely one sided fight!
Do you know who I owe this humiliation to? I could have crushed that newbie Ancestor with just a glare!"
<Page28>
Oh, She's pissed off. ......
But right now, I don't want to think about that.
As a matter of reality, I'd like to know if she can defeat that vampire.......
<Page29>
"I can't. Vlov is better than me right now. #We're simply outperforming him, if we fight him without a plan, he'll surely kill us."
"That's quite direct coming from you, you were so angry earlier."
<Page30>
"It's just a fact. I'm not going to jump to conclusions and hope for the best, because it's obvious."
<Page31>
........I got a little intimidated when she said that.
When it comes to fighting, Arcueid has a thoroughly serious thought process.
When I see her cold-heartedness, I realize again, after all this time, that she is also a vampire.
