But even if I say that, this is really a first for me.
The only first aid stuff I can think of is gauze for covering the wound, antiseptic, bandages, and painkillers.
The other thing is nutrition. At any rate, she definitely needs some.
<Page2>
Fortunately, I have a ton of money.
Even if it's an amateurish idea, it's better than coming up empty-handed. You never know what might be of help to that woman.
With that in mind, I buy whatever I could think of.
<Page3>
"Hey wait, that tickles!"
"........."
<Page4>
Ignoring her laid-back voice, I apply the gauze as delicately as I can.
The wound on Arcueid's abdomen isn't that big.
<Page5>
...No, a horizontal, four-centimeter-deep gash would have been fatal for any human, but according to Arcueid,
"A wound like this isn't a big deal!"
Or something like that.
<Page6>
In any case, it seems her internal organs will heal on their own in no time. This is so out of the ordinary that I don't even want to question it.
The bleeding has stopped and all that's left to do is to close the wound, but from this point on, things are different from what I might expect from a human. // emphasis on human mine. そこから先が思うようにいかないのだとか lit. From here, things won't go as I expect referring to Arcueid's toughness.
<Page7>
Although it might be a waste of time for such a large wound, I apply some antiseptic on it to prevent bacterial infection.
I was afraid that she would go crazy from being soaked, but she doesn't budge at all. Rather...
"Hmm? Did you do something just now?"
She doesn't seem very sensitive... no, rather she's tough.
<Page8>
"...Alright."
I place gauze on the wound and carefully wrap a bandage around it.
"Ahahaha, stop it, you're too good at this, Shiki!"
<Page9>
Arcueid lets out a cheerful laugh, seemingly amused by something.
Despite being unresponsive to the antiseptic, it appears that the bandage is able to tickle her.
<Page10>
"......"
I ignore her and fasten the bandage on with a pin. Wounds are said to stop bleeding if you apply pressure, so I give the end of the bandage a final tug to pull it tight.
"―――Ouch. Hey, I'm deducting points for that, Shiki."
<Page11>
"........."
Phew. With this, I've done everything that I can do for the time being.
Incidentally, I've closed the curtains again out of concern for Arcueid.
<Page12>
"...Alright. I only really made it look good on the outside. How do you feel?
Are you able to move, Arcueid?"
<Page13>
"Yeah, I have no problem moving around. But my insides are still pretty messed up, so I'm not really as nimble as I'd like to be."
<Page14>
"Oh? Well, you'll have to deal with that on your own.
My specialty is cutting. Healing is outside of my jurisdiction."
I move away from Arcueid and sit down against the wall.
<Page15>
"Thank you for your patience, you can go to sleep now.
You'll get better as soon as you sleep and recover your strength, right? I'll keep an eye on you, so just be quiet and go to sleep."
<Page16>
"No, my wounds won't recover even if I sleep. It's just like you said, sleeping can only help you recover from fatigue.
In my case, my strength recovers purely with the passage of time. By nightfall, I'll have recovered enough to move around normally."
<Page17>
Even if she says that, it's still not good for my mental health to see her in pain.
<Page18>
"―――Just go to sleep already.
You look like you're in pain just talking to me."
"That may be true, but you're still awake.
It'd be a waste if I were to sleep right now."
<Page19>
Arcueid sits upright on the bed.
She's in full-on chatter mode.
"―――Geez."
I don't have a choice.
I've got some questions I need to ask her as well, so I'll just talk with her for a bit.
<Page20>
"Arcueid. Can I ask you about what happened at the hotel yesterday?"
"...That's right. Pretty natural you'd want to talk about that after what you saw."
<Page21>
"That guy from yesterday... I believe he called himself Vlov――what the hell is he?
I understand that he's a vampire. That grandiose outfit makes him look much more vampire-like than you after all. But―――"
<Page22>
That blue flame. What was that flame that filled the hallway and burned humans but left everything else intact? That didn't fit with how I picture vampires at all.
<Page23>
"Hmph. What do you mean he's more 'vampire-like' than me?
Though... it's just like you said.
His body isn't falling apart and his Principle is fairly small-scale. He's the sort of 'orthodox' vampire that humans imagine.//Principle / scale here are 原理/規模
―――That is, if you exclude that river of flame, right?"
<Page24>
"Exactly... As I thought, that fire is pretty abnormal even from your perspective, right? Is he stronger than you?"
...As soon as I say that, Arcueid lets out an exaggerated sigh.
<Page25>
"Well, you see. I was killed by a certain somebody, which made me drop to such a level where I have to 'fight' even a second-rate Dead Apostle like him.
If you were to compare my <power|L i f e s c a l e> with Vlov's right now, he would be slightly stronger."//Power ruby is 存在規模
<Page26>
"...I-I see.
So if you were in your normal condition, you would be able to defeat him somehow, right?"
<Page27>
"What do you mean 'somehow'? It wouldn't even be a fight in that case!
Geez, who do you think is responsible for this humiliating situation in the first place? If I were to fight him seriously, I would have crushed that wannabe Ancestor with just a glare!"
<Page28>
Ah, I made her mad...
But right now, I'm not interested in these 'what if' scenarios.
What I really want to know is whether Arcueid can defeat that vampire in her current condition...
<Page29>
"I can't. Vlov is stronger than me right now.# My abilities have simply dropped below his, so if we fight him without a strategy, we'll get killed."
"T-That's quite direct coming from you. Even though you were so angry earlier."
<Page30>
"It's just a fact. This situation is quite clear, so there's no point in hoping for the best or making predictions to the contrary."
<Page31>
...I got a little intimidated when she said that.
When it comes to fighting, Arcueid has a very tough and thorough thought process.
As I witness her cold-hearted nature in front of me, I come to realize again, even after all this time, that she is definitely a vampire.
