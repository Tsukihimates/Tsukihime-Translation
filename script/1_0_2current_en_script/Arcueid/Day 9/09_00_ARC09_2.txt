"...... Anyway, first I need to get up."
　I still have other things to think about, but right now I need to wake up.
　It is 7:30.
　Normally, I would have already finished my breakfast by now.
<Page2>
"Hisui.......is not here"
　Hisui, who had always stood in the background like a shadow, was nowhere to be found.
<Page3>
She probably came to wake me up several times in the morning, 
But since I didn't wake up, she left the room each time and is probably working on something else right now.
<Page4>
"I guess I was just too tired to wake up.......
　I exhaled deeply.
　I'll take a nap beforehand tonight and then meet up with Arcueid.
<Page5>
　I'm not going to think about the unusual events of last night right now.
　I can wait until nightfall to talk to Arcueid about it.
　If I don't get back to my normal routine at least during the day, I'll be in trouble too.
<Page6>
"Okay. First, breakfast."
　Although I don't have an appetite, I can't start without nutrition.
　I need to eat a good breakfast to get rid of last night's fatigue.......
<Page7>
"What?"
　I tried to get up from the bed, but my body fell down haphazardly.
　It's like a tree being knocked over by a woodcutter.
　I fall from my shoulders onto the wooden floor.

"――――――"
My arms and legs were weak and I couldn't even get up.
Fortunately, my consciousness is fading and I have no fear.
<Page9>
My body is numb, but my breathing is normal, and I observe it as if it were just another anemia.
And then.
I was lying on the floor, looking up at the hands of the clock vaguely until after 8 o'clock when Hisui came to visit once more.
