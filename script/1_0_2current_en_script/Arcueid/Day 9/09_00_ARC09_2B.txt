"...My sincerest apologizes please berate me as you see fit.
It was my fault for not noticing your condition."
"It's not your fault, Hisui. It happens all the time, no need to take it too seriously."
<Page2>
I lie down on the bed and lean my upper body against the backrest while talking to Hisui.
After I collapsed, Hisui came to check on the room and helped me out, and now I'm settled in bed.
<Page3>
"My sister will contact the school.
......Is it alright for the reason of your absence be due to illness?"
"Yeah, that's fine. I'm just a little tired, but I do feel guilty about missing school though."
<Page4>
"If you are so tired that you can no longer stand up, you can no longer just be called tired. Shiki-sama is the eldest son of the Tohno family. You need to take better care of yourself."
<Page5>
"No, I do take good care of myself."
Hisui scolded me, and I replied with a wry smile.
<Page6>
The panic Hisui had after she found me was quite amazing.
First, she opened the door and froze for a few seconds.
Then, she rushed over to pick me up, but froze with a hard face for about a minute.
<Page7>
She rushed around the room and paced for a few more minutes until she went to call Kohaku-san.
In the end, Hisui never touched my body, but I could clearly feel her devotion.
<Page8>
After that, I returned to bed with Kohaku-san's help and was made porridge as a meal for the sick, which I have been eating since.
<Page9>
Akiha was already on her way to school, which was a blessing in disguise.
If I had collapsed half an hour earlier, she would have been late for school too.
<Page10>
"At any rate, thank you Hisui.
I've had a good meal, and this will help with the anemia, so you can go back to work."
<Page11>
"Very well, sir.
But at the very least you should be examined.
Dr. Arach will be here this morning, so why don't you take this opportunity to have a thorough physical examination?"
<Page12>
What a surprise. Is that strange doctor here too?
......I really don't need a checkup, but I'm not sure Hisui will go unless I say yes.
For checkup I will...
C:>go with Dr. Arach.
C:>pick Kohaku-san.
