"'...... Akiha is at school.
Kohaku-san is out shopping, and Hisui is cleaning downstairs......"
<Page2>
Right now, I'm the only one in this hallway.
It's against the rules to go in a deceased person's room, but I'm a member of the family.
Going into my own father's room shouldn't be that big of a deal.
<Page3>
The room is at the end of the hallway, locked.
I take off my glasses and cut the lock's 'line'.
<Page4>
......There is no turning back now.
I looked around the hallway, making sure no one is watching me, and go inside.
<Page5>
"What's with this room ......, isn't it a bit too dark?"
Even with the curtains closed, it shouldn't be this dark.
I put my hand on the wall and try to find a light switch, but stop myself.
<Page6>
If I press the switch, it's possible that someone might discover that I'm in the room.
I know I'm being overly cautious, but I'll just use the light from my phone to illuminate the room.
<Page7>
".......It's a lot tidier than I thought it would be."
The interior is the same size as Akiha's office.
Well, since it was used by my father until last month, there's no reason for it to be in disrepair.
<Page8>
The bookshelf has been kept just as it was before his death.
The only question that remains, then, is why it's so dark.
I turn my cell phone to the window, trying to find it if the curtains are the cause of the darkness.
<Page9>
"------, #Huh?"
---There.
The room is sealed off in a manner that no normal room should be.
<Page10>
"'...... iron ...... bars ......? Why ......?"
I don't believe it.
It's insane, but the sight in front of me is real.
The windows of my father's room are completely sealed.
<Page11>
It's not just the curtains that are blocking the sunlight.
The windows are all lined with heavy-duty iron bars.
It's as if they're trying to stop something from coming in.
Or.
Maybe they're trying to trap what's inside.
<Page12>
".................."
This was a bad idea.
I don't know understand this darkness indicates, but I do know that this is a secret ...... cage to lock of madness that must not be seen..//I recommend taking a look at this one. It a bit tricky out of MTL, so feel free to modify this at your discretion.
<Page13>
I have to leave this room right now.
No one can find out I was here. ....Not even Akiha or Kohaku.
<Page14>
If they find out, then...
I don't think our relationship will remain like this.
<Page15>
"...... No, I've come this far, what am I scared of?"
I move forward, using the light from my cell phone.
I'm curious about the bookshelf, but there's no time to waste on that.//Oh boy, can't wait to see how what's in the bookshelf this screws with my head in the next VN.
<Page16>
First, let's go through my father's desk drawers.
It's not for any specific purpose, but Makihisa was such a meticulous person.
His desk might have some documents about Akiha, me, or the company.
<Page17>
There was nothing in the desk drawers.
But only until the second drawer.
The third drawer has a lock on it.
It seems to have been left unopened after my father's death.
"............"
I take off my glasses again and "kill" the lock.
<Page18>
"...... A book? Is this a diary?"
Inside the drawer is a bundle of papers and a thick diary.
The papers seem to be a family tree of the Tohno family.
<Page19>
"Why's this here? It looks really old."
This paper must have been passed down the Tohno family for generations.
There's no doubt about it.
After Tohno Makihisa, there are the names of Tohno SHIKI and Tohno Akiha.
Yeah, but...
<Page20>
"...... What's this? Tohno Makihisa adopted a son nine years ago ....... Oh, but he died of an illness shortly after."
<Page21>
Nine years ago, I was eight years old.
Even though it was a long time ago, I have no memory of him at all.
...... Maybe he was a mistress's child, and was kept away from the house? //I would give this one a look.
What about my father?
<Page22>
"...... No way.
......All the heads of the family are short-lived. My father died of illness before he was fifty, and before that the previous head died in an accident when he was thirty ...... and before that another committed suicide when he was eighteen......."
---- No, wait.
No, no, no, this is crazy.
<Page23>
I look through the family tree again.
......I'm not mistaken.
Every member of the Tohno family has died in an unusual way.
Suicide. Accidents. Murder. Disappearance.
......No one has passed away peacefully.
<Page24>
"............"
These records can only be described as haunted.
What's unusual is that the majority of the deaths are suicides.
The heads of the Tohno family took their own lives either before or after they reached adulthood...
<Page25>
The light is fading from my vision.
I feel as if blood is pooling in the back of my head.
My limbs lose strength, and my breathing becomes more and more laboured.
I turn my attention to the diary, as if to escape my dizziness and sense of foreboding.
I turn to the beginning of the diary. The date at the top is in 2004.
......This is the year when the child adopted by Makihisa died of an unknown illness.
<Page26>
I examine the words written in the diary.
The handwriting is Makihisa's, neat but nervous.
I feverently read out the contents of the day's entry.
<Page27>
""......The Tohno family is cursed.
Since the modern age, every child born in our family is cursed with the ...... of......
<Page28>
This is from ten years ago. The ink is so faded that I can't read it well.
<Page29>
"...... Of course ...... I am no exception, nor are my children.
Akiha has a special ...... strong ...... I'm sad to think about my child's future. ............ According to the doctor who was referred to me, if you educate your child strictly from an early age, the onset will be........."//These next couple ones are supposed to be from faded diary ttext.
<Page30>
"I can't tell ...... Akiha that she needs another surgery tonight....that girl must resent me. She must hate me for treating her harshly for no reason. It's all part of the Tonho hereditary...
However, I'm relieved. No matter how much Akiha's... blood is near...though one could say that, compared to her older brother, Akiha is far more human.
<Page31>
...... What the hell is this?
The Tohno family is cursed ......?
Hereditary? Did they perform surgery on Akiha?
And what's that last line about?
Older brother. Older brother. Older brother.
I don't really want to believe that he's talking about me...
<Page32>
"Hello, Shiki"
...... My stomach, feels hot ......?
I've had my chest wound go numb many times, but this is a new experience for me.
<Page33>
The pain feels as if my internal organs are being pierced with a burning hot iron rod.
Then, my sense of touch begins to fade from my toes all the way up to my head.
My body slumps against the desk, my outstretched hands lose their grip, and I fall flat on my back.
<Page34>
"This diary isn't good. After all, it hasn't been censored yet. I didn't even plan for you to see it.//Someone do this from scratch.
"....................."
My consciousness fades.
That man... he is...
<Page35>
"I would have liked you to have stirred up the inexperienced family head a little more.
I don't know how, but it's my misfortune that I got the key."
<Page36>
...... I notice that I have stopped breathing for some time now.
The lines of death, the headaches that had been ever present, are now gone.
...... I see.
I didn't realize it until now.
That nasty headache was my lifeline.
<Page37>
Without it, I can't stay awake any longer.
My body, which had always been on the edge of death, falls into a sleep from which it will never wake...//Feel free to phrase this more poetically if you want.
