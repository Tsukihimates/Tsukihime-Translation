......I hear 2 people speaking.
<Page2>
"'...... Akiha-sama, aren't you going to call for a docotor?
"Don't be stupid, Hisui. There is no way I can call doctor, Nii-san's wounds are no ordinary wounds.......!"
<Page3>
...A ki ha／and／Hi su i／are talking.
This is shi ki room.
I am sleeping on my bed.
<Page4>
......Finally, my consciousness became clear.
I tried to get up, but my body wouldn't move as I wanted it to.
<Page5>
There was no pain in my chest, but my body felt heavy as lead.
My eyes and mouth seemed to be the only things that were working satisfactorily.
<Page6>
"What the hell were you thinking, Hisui?
You know that you should not let Nii-san near that place......!"
<Page7>
"I'm very.............sorry"
<Page8>
"You cannot apologize for this. The reason I made you my brother's servant was to avoid this kind of situation, remember?
How could you forget that and do what you were doing? ......!"
<Page9>
Akiha is angry, displaying a level of emotion that would be unimaginable under normal circumstances.
In contrast, Hisui, who is being scolded, remains downcast.
<Page10>
I have no idea what's going on.
I'm not sure what's going on, but I could at least tell that Hisui was getting scolded because of me.
<Page11>
"Now. Would you please speak up, Hisui?
What have you been doing all day?
......You didn't report his collapse this morning, and you even let him go to that forest. This was done with a clear agenda, wasn't it? Otherwise, you'd be dumber than a dog.
―――Answer me, Hisui. Are you trying to go against me?"
<Page12>
Hisui doesn't answer Akiha's question.
The air between the two of them grew heavier and heavier.
<Page13>
Ahika bites her lips tightly and takes a step closer to Hisui. 
......It's obvious to me that Akiha is about to raise her hand at Hisui.
And Hisui is trying to accept it silently, with her head down.
<Page14>
"―――Hey, wait, Akiha."
"Nii-san, you're awake!?"
"Yeah, Akiha, you were making so much noise that I just woke up."
<Page15>
"Ah............."
Akiha awkwardly averted her gaze.
Hisui kept looking down and wouldn't look at me.
<Page16>
"...... Don't be too hard on Hisui.
I don't know what's going on, but you were arguing about my collapse, right? Then it's not Hisui's fault. This is just me collapsing on my own."
<Page17>
I put all my strength into my arms and managed to get my upper body out of bed.
That's all I can do for now. I don't think I can even move a finger anymore.
But since Hisui was depressed, I had to force myself and pretend to be fine.
<Page18>
"Don't fight over something like that. You look like a grown-up, but you're still a kid."
<Page19>
"But... You have never been in a coma for more than 10 hours before. If you didn't wake up, what am I supposed to do......!"
<Page20>
"Dummy, don't say such morbid things.
This is just anemia......# What the heck! It's already ten o'clock?"
"......Yes. You have been unconscious from noon until now, Nii-san."
<Page21>
Akiha speaks with a reserved tone.
But my concern was not about my own body, but about my promise to Arcueid.
<Page22>
"Ten o'clock at night, next time be sure to be on time."
Arcueid's eyes were rather serious when he said that.
If I break the rules, what kinds of unreasonable demands will I have to face this time......!
<Page23>
"Oh no, I have to go to......!
Akiha, I'm sorry. I'm going out, so take care of the rest. Don't pick on Hisui too much."
<Page24>
"Do――― don't say such foolish things yourself!
I will no longer ask you where you go every night. I will not ask, so please take care of yourself at least tonight......!"
<Page25>
"Akiha........."
Akiha's voice could already be described as a begging plea.
If she was so seriously worried, my resolve might be dulled.
<Page26>
"But this happens all the time, you know.
When I was in middle school, I used to fall down twice a day."
<Page27>
"That's why I'm even more worried because of.......
―――Nii-san. I beg you, please listen to me at least for today."
<Page28>
Akiha looks at me with a serious gaze.
I'm―――――
C:>Going to listen to Akiha.
C:>Going to see Arcueid.
