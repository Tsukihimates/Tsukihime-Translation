...Yes, you're right.//There are Dr.Arach lines ahead, I left them untranslated
Kohaku-san will be busy with her duties, so let's ask Dr.Arach to do this.
<Page2>
She may not be the most reassuring person, but she's still a specialist.
She specializes in surgery, so she can take care of trauma.
I may have internal bleeding from the encounter with Noel last night, so it's a good idea to have her check me out just in case.
<Page3>
I came here because I heard you wanted me to.
"Dear customer, I can't seem to spot anything out of order, though? I came flying expecting you'd have lost an eye or arm or so, this ain't gonna satisfy my desires, you know? Oh, I meant that mostly in a lust for knowledge kinda way, well, in a sexual way too , of course."
"......"
<Page4>
Dr. Arach grumbled and complained, but she did a good job of examining me.
After having my heartbeat and pulse measured, she also examined the condition of my legs, which she had been worried about after the incident with Vlov.
<Page5>
All results are normal, no issues.
Unsurprisingly, Dr.Arach pouts all like 'Oh dear me, what a waste of time'
<Page6>
"Well, you temperature's down a bit, so I'd like to try something out.
Hmm, let's try placenta this time.
I know it's originally a nutritional supplement for women, but I recommend it.
<Page7>
Placenta... the extracted female organ.
It is mainly used for cosmetic effects to improve the skin, but as a matter of fact, it can accelerate recovery and is said to have anti-aging effects.
<Page8>
"Please do. I used to get them at my old doctor's office once in a while.
<Page9>
"Oh, dear. Thank you for talking so quickly. As expected of a sickly boy, you're used to pain, aren't you?
"I'm not used to it. I only had injections once in a while.
<Page10>
"Mmm-hmm. "Yes, then show me your hands again.
 はーい、ザッキューン♡ #患部ごと患者のハートをイチコロよぉ♡」
...I think I just heard the worst onomatopoeia for pricking a needle.
<Page11>
The injection is done and the consultation concludes.
But,
<Page12>
All that was left to do was to leave the room, but Dr. Arach kept staring at my body and refused to move.
<Page13>
"D-Doctor? Is there anything else I can do for you?"
That's right. I caught a glimpse of it during the examination, so I was curious.
Shiki-chan, would you mind taking off your clothes?
"What's...? What do you mean, "take off your clothes"?
<Page14>
"Rightrightright. Oh, no need to get all naked~. I don't wanna get killed by [the young lady] juuust yet.
What I wanna see is Shiki-chan's upper booody! Huhuhu... there's a suuuper big scar on your chest, isn't theeere?"
"Oh, that? ...Well alright, I can do that"
<Page15>
I dont't like the idea, but since Dr. Arach is a doctor, I have no reason to refuse.
I take off my shirt and sit down on the bed.
<Page16>
"Oh! It's nice, it's nice, it's like maple, it's so juicy! I thought you had good arms, but now that I see you as a whole, you're so attractive! Even if you're stuck in a hole for the winter, you won't have to worry about food with Shiki-chan alone.
<Page17>
Dr. Arach is rubbing her shoulders, upper arms, and flanks, looking truly happy.
In combination with her open-hearted attire, she honestly can't help her sexual desire.
<Page18>
"...Um. Aren't you supposed to be examining the scar on my chest?"
"Oops, right, fail fail.
...Hmm, I see, I see. ...Whatever you used, it's completely sealed. Even though I'm weak, your metabolic function is as good as a normal person's, or maybe it's just easier for you to survive. Oh, I'm so sorry. Shiki-chan, there's nothing to draw from it. I have nothing to add."
<Page19>
Satisfied after two minutes of observation, Dr. Arach left the bed.
<Page20>
"But it's a terrible wound. Not only ordinary people, but even vampires in the movies would be dead.
I wonder how much it hurt when you were in the accident?
I'm getting nervous just thinking about it♡"
<Page21>
"Oh, I see. It seems that a piece of glass fell and pierced me.
When I heard the word "vampire", I panicked and gave an explanation that I didn't need to give.
<Page22>
"Oh, no, you don't remember? You don't remember?
Then that's another story. You've come back here, Shiki-chan. You can't escape it no matter how hard you try, you know?
---Wait.
Didn't this woman just say something strange?
<Page23>
"Nah, it's nothing, it's nothing!
That's it, I'm out of here. I hope we can meet again someday when the timing is right.
<Page24>
With a clack of her heels, Dr. Arach left.
I wonder if it is...
Although I have no reason to believe it, the back of his head reminded me of a spider sliding toward its prey.
