......she's not going to give up.
In fact, if she gets any closer, it's going to be a fight for sure. In that case, I'm going to be the one who's put down.

"Geez, I get it, here!
......listen. Return it as soon as you're done with it."

I hand the glasses to Arcueid.
She closely inspects it.

"Shiki. Is there anyone in this city who gave you these?"
"......I don't think so. It was seven years ago, and she wasn't the kind of person who stays in one place."
<Page5>
"Yeah. I'm glad I don't have to deal with more of them.
......it's probably safer to stay away from Blue, though."
Arcueid falls silent with a serious face.
<Page6>
"Arcueid. You know Sensei, who made these glasses......?"
<Page7>
"I do. She's one of the four surviving magicians.
These glasses are an extraordinary piece of work. I'm not sure if I can break them with my current strength."
Arcueid's face grows more serious.
<Page8>
"......were you planning to break them?"
"What?
Did I just say that?"
<Page9>
"I knew you were going to break them......."
"Give them back," I said, taking the glasses back from Arcueid.
<Page10>
"Damn. You're the one who said I'll go insane without these glasses.
Or do you want me to be like that, huh?"
<Page11>
"It's not that, but...
It's just that I didn't like the way you look at them."
"..............."
I have no idea what vampires think.
This girl could've destroyed my lifeline.
<Page12>
"......just don't get any more crazy ideas.
I can't live without them, even though the memories of Sensei are important. If I see the lines all the time, I'm going to get headaches."
