<Page1>
"Yes, it's a rather nice room.
I wouldn't complain about spending the night here."
<Page2>
Arcueid happily looks around the hotel room.
"----"
I'm speechless at this turn of events.
<Page3>
"So, what do you specifically want me to do?"
"I'll move for now.
My room is not suitable for protection.......that's right, let's go to a higher place with a better view."
<Page4>
And here we are.
Arcueid stopped a cab on the main street and drove to the next town.
She checked into a room at one of the most expensive hotels in the area, she didn't just rent a room......but rented out the entire top floor. Almost like a celebrity.
<Page5>
"Oh, it's so tall!
Human building technology is really improving rapidly.
What do you call this kind of thing? Rapid progress?
Well, it doesn't matter! Look over there, Shiki, the alleyway we were in just now has become so tiny!"
<Page6>
With the closed curtains slightly open, she is enjoying the view from the window.
I'm not really in the mood for this.
<Page7>
This place is more like a fortress built on the top floor of a hotel than a hotel room.
The curtains that block out the sunlight, the furniture that decorates the room, and the materials used for the walls and doors are several times more luxurious and sturdy than those of most hotels.
<Page8>
Since we're renting the top floor, no other guests will come to this floor. You can even see a monitor in the room that shows the lobby on the first floor.
......I realize once again that the people who use this type of hotels are from privileged class.
<Page9>
"Let's hide out here tonight. Oh and don't worry about the hotel fee. #I'm rich, so I'll treat you."
<Page10>
Arcueid says cheerfully as she moves away from the window.
Looks like she got tired of the bird's eye view of the city.
<Page11>
"......Arcueid. What are you thinking?"
I sigh.
<Page12>
"What do you mean, I'm thinking about a lot of things."
"No, that's not the point.
I don't want to be in a hotel room with......"
<Page13>
I was about to say something, but then I stop.
All I have to do is keep an eye on this self-proclaimed vampire.
I don't have to say anything else.
<Page14>
"No, nothing. Do what you want."
"Weird Shiki.
You're so unpredictable, getting angry all of a sudden and then going silent."
"What's the fun in that?" Arcueid laughs.
<Page15>
"............"
Meanwhile, over here, I'm standing close to the door, observing the room carefully.
I'm the complete opposite of the relaxed Arcueid.
<Page16>
I'm exhausted and I want to rest, but if I sit down on the sofa now, I would sink into it and sleep.
I can't be that defenseless, no matter how desperate I am.
<Page17>
"Shiki, do you want something to drink? There seem to be a lot of drinks here!"
".................."
A brainless voice comes from the mini-bar in the room.
......the bottle in Arcueid's hand is, needless to say, some sort of alcohol.
<Page18>
"You know, I'm underage and you're offering me alco...."
I almost say it, but stop myself.
I don't know if she's underage or not. I'm not interested and I'm not going to ask.
<Page19>
"I'll choose for myself later. More importantly..."
No matter how tired or baffled I am, there is a question I need to ask.
<Page20>
What is this girl in front of me?
In other words, how dangerous is the situation I'm in?
I can't even sit on the couch without knowing these things to the best of my ability, even if they are outside of my common sense.
<Page21>
"......More importantly, I have some more questions for you.
After that, I can relax and rest."
<Page22>
"I don't mind, but what's the matter, you're all stressed up suddenly."
".................."
I've never opened up in front of her......but that's okay.
<Page23>
"I'm serious.
In the end, what's your purpose?"
<Page24>
"Me? I'm just chasing a vampire.
Because killing vampires is my role."
"Yeah, I know you said that.
But you're a vampire too, aren't you?"
<Page25>
"What, you still don't believe me, Shiki?"
<Page26>
"Don't worry, I believe you enough.
What I'm trying to say is, why would you, a vampire, kill another vampire? Theoratically, that's just not right."
"Oh, don't humans kill each other too?"
<Page27>
"I don't want you to kill your own people.
......you know, vampires are demons that suck the blood of humans. right? Then shouldn't your target be humans.
What you're killing is....."
I realize what I'm saying and stop myself.
<Page28>
"Bloodsucking and killing are two different things.
But still, I understand what you are saying. You say that we should help each other because we are the same species, right?
But vampires are like unique species that have evolved differently from each other, even though they are derived from the same great source.
They don't have the same sense of fellowship as humans do."
<Page29>
"......so the vampire you're looking for is different from you?"
<Page30>
"Yes, a different kind of vampire than me.
The vampire I'm chasing is a Dead Apostle, so it's almost exactly the same as the image you have of vampires.
They suck human blood and use the people they kill to gradually increase their power.
You remember that burning corpse, right? That's what happens to people killed by vampires. Even though they are dead as humans, they can't die yet and are still alive."
<Page31>
"......Dead but Alive......"
The corpse that appeared in the alleyway......in the story of vampires, people whose blood has been sucked become new vampires and attack people.
In this way, their numbers increase, and in the end, they turn an entire village into a land of death.......
<Page32>
"Yes. That's the kind of vampire that lurks in this town.
I'm not interested in sucking blood, and I'm not one of their kind. So I don't mind killing him."
<Page33>
Arcueid says plainly.
Apparently, there are many different types of vampires.
<Page34>
"......I'm creeped out after all this time.
You're the one who told me to shield you so you could kill him."
<Page35>
"Yes, that was my intention at first.
I was planning to use you as a shield. Even if you tried to run away, I would have tied you up with the Mystic Eyes and finished you from fear.
But as I was talking to you, I changed my mind."
<Page36>
......so she was planning to use force from the beginning.
Okay, I'll never forget that.
"But why did you change your mind?"
<Page7>
"Hmm, I was wrong.
Until you killed me and I restored myself, I thought you were from the Church.
If that's the case, there was a chance that you had the location of the enemy and can be counted on as a force to be reckoned with."
<Page38>
"But you are just a normal person. You don't know anything about vampires, let alone where the enemy's coffin is."
<Page39>
"......yeah, there's no way they'd send a representative to such an atheist country in the first place, and they wouldn't work alone in the first place. A master and his apprentice in a two-man team is their basic rule......."
<Page40>
Arcueid mumbles to herself.
We're getting sidetracked, and I'm feeling pretty left out.
<Page41>
"Anyway, it means that my target has returned from you to my 'original prey'.
Which is kind of a bummer, I guess."
<Page42>
She says something disturbing in a lively voice.
......damn. She still hasn't let it go completely.
Even though it's natural for her to hate me after what I did, it's not good for my heart to hear her say "I want to kill you" while smiling.
I knew she was going to kill me the moment I let my guard down...
<Page43>
"Are we done with the serious stuff? Then I'm going to bed!"
"Wha--?"
And then, #with a bounce in her step, #she walks over to the bed and lay down on it.
<Page44>
"I feel good, I'll sleep until the sun goes down.
Shiki, you should get some rest while you can. Vampires can't be active during the day, so it'll be nighttime when you will have to be on full scale watch."
<Page45>
......you. Do you understand that you've just said something that negates your entire existence?
"I'm fine.
---I think I've reached my limit. Well, good night, Shiki. Wake me up when the sun goes down."
<Page46>
"He...Hey!"
"-------"
Arcueid suddenly falls asleep, like a car that got its engine turned off.
<Page47>
"-----Seriously?"
Unbelievable, she's really asleep.......
I feel like an idiot for standing so close to the door so I could escape just as I get a chance.
<Page48>
Is it okay? I know it's not for me to say, but is that really what this girl wants?　
I'm in a situation where I've been forcibly brought here. I can easily escape now.
<Page49>
No, to begin with,
Even though I don't have the same urges anymore,
"......I've already killed you once, you know....."
So how can she fall asleep so carelessly.
<Page50>
"....................."
I stare at Arcueid's face.
Her ample breasts rise and fall, indicating that she is breathing.
Her body, lying on the bed, does not move a muscle.
<Page51>
Sleeping like a painting.
Eye lids gently closed.
Long lashes and pretty lips that look fresh even without lipstick.
<Page52>
The bulge of her breasts is well-shaped.
The line of her hips looks like a haze of hills on the horizon.
Her legs are long and slender.
Innocent yet sensual, such contradictory words come to my mind.
<Page53>
".................."
A girl like that, asleep and unprotected in a royal hotel like this.
I've only known her for a short time, and yet she trusts me, the person who brutally killed her, with all her heart.
<Page54>
"What an idiot, this girl."
......yeah, I think she's so stupid and honest that I'm a little worried.
<Page55>
Anyway, this is the crux.
This may be the last turning point where I can turn back.
<Page56>
　You'll be my shield, this girl said.
　But I'm......
C:>Enough with the madness. Let's run.
C:>So much for getting lost. Let's stay.
