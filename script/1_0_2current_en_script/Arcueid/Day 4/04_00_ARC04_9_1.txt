<Page1>
"......Alright."
...I take a small, deep breath and shake off my doubts.
I look around the room for anything I could use as a weapon, but find nothing.
...Swallowing my hesitation, I take the knife out of my bag and walk to the door.
<Page2>
"―――Shiki?"
"...I'm going to find out what's happening.
Don't leave the room until I come back."
Arcueid seems like she wants to say something but I brush off her gaze and go out into the hallway.
<Page3>
The lights in the hallway are off, seemingly due to a problem with the electrical system.
The only thing lit is the elevator hall at the end of the corridor.
My throat hurts even more than it did when I was in the room. The air surrounding me is hot and rough like sandpaper.
<Page4>
The hallway is frighteningly quiet.
There isn't even a single noise.
Not even a single sign of life.
No ■■ running away,
and no ■■ burning up.
An all-enveloping space of complete silence that made me want to believe that the scene I saw on the monitor was a lie.
<Page5>
"......There's nothing unusual, is there?"
I walk down the corridor.
The sweat on my forehead coalesces into droplets that roll down my face.
It is so overly quiet that I start to believe that I'm a foreign entity.
Foreign... foreign... foreign...
It is customary for vermin that disturb the atmosphere of a place to be crushed.
<Page6>
"―――Hah―――"
Once again, I take a deep breath to calm down.
I adjust my grip on the knife, wrapping my hand around the handle to prevent it from slipping due to my sweat.
...I feel nauseous.
There's a sensation at my temple.
As though the nerves between the back of my eyes and my brain are being stretched.
<Page7>
Are my eyeballs trying to sink into my brain?
Or is my brain trying to swallow my eyeballs?
Biting down on the dull pain, I continue walking along the scorching path.
<Page8>
"――――――"
It hurts.
My eyes hurt.
My head becomes heavy, and I feel like I'm going to collapse.
Yeah, I know this.
It's the feeling I get right before I have an anemic attack.
<Page9>
"Haa―――――ah"
It hurts.
As the pain grows even more unbearable, I take off my glasses.
<Page10>
The elevator comes into view.
It's a long corridor.
More than 20 meters remain between me and the elevators.
It's still far away.
Go back, I tell myself.
―――Somehow.
I feel as though if I go any further, there will be no turning back.
<Page11>
I hear a sound.
As if to disturb the harmony of this pure clean space devoid of life,
the chime of an elevator bell rings.
<Page12>
It's so ominous that I stop in my tracks.
I can do nothing but stare at the uninvited guest.
<Page13>
The floor indicator stops moving.
The cab arrives.
I can see the lines on the elevator door in the distance.
No, it's more like,
the lines are so bunched up that they look like a wall of speckles.
<Page14>
The door opens.
The small, iron box hangs agape.
<Page15>
The inside of the box
is awash with
the flesh of the recently deceased.
<Page16>
"――――――"
I stop breathing.
As my brain rejects my thoughts, so too do my lungs abandon their functions.
<Page17>
Inside the iron box known as an elevator,
there is red flesh tightly crammed together.
In the midst of it all are two dogs gobbling up the meat.
<Page18>
My vision turns bright red.
Red viscous fluid begins to flow out of the elevator with a gurgling sound.
Within that sea of blood, bodies, bones, brains, fingers, and organs,
the two black dogs were the only living creatures.
<Page19>
"Ah―――, ah―――"
My mind refuses to accept this scene as reality.
At the end of the corridor, inside the elevator, the dogs are scavenging off peoples' bodies.
Through a vent inside of the elevator leading to the floor below,
countless screams can be heard leaking out that weren't there before.
<Page20>
I can hear them if I listen carefully.
The scratching, scraping sounds of flesh being chewed on,
the screams calling for help, the sounds of death and agony that barely resemble human language.
<Page21>
My brain, directly connected to my hearing, can imagine it.
Although I can't see it, images form within my head.
Images of people being burned alive,
images of people being eaten alive and their forms being disfigured.
<Page22>
There was a man that had noticed the unusual temperature. The moment he opened the door to leave, he was enveloped by the conflagration and died.//These lines fill the page - if you edit these and make them longer, you _must_ play-test changes
There was a girl who was locked in her room crying. The flames that rose from the lobby blanketed the floor and the girl's body was turned to ash from the inside, like a steamed fish.
There were adults that scrambled for the elevator as fast as they could. But the elevator was filled with dozens of former guests. These guests, no longer human, consumed the adults that had arrived to their heart's content.
<Page23>
The screams were divided between the fear of being eaten and the despair of burning alive.
No one was an exception.
Beneath my feet, inside this large box of a hotel,
lies a hellscape so close to me that it makes my skin crawl.
<Page24>
"――――――"
I feel nauseous.
But there's no way I can throw up.
Because if I did that―――I would also become one with the sea of red.
<Page25>
"Ha―――a. Ha. Ah. Ha, "
I force my stalled breathing to resume.
Gritting my teeth, I take back control of myself.
<Page26>
The dogs in the elevator notice my presence.
After coming back to my senses, I realize that the noise from downstairs has ceased.
<Page27>
"......Ha"
In other words.
That means that there's no one left alive anymore.
<Page28>
The two black dogs begin to run.
In this hunting ground, I'm their final prey.
<Page29>
The dogs head toward me.
I can see countless lines on their bodies.
<Page30>
―――But despite this,
my paralyzed mind doesn't instruct me to fight or to run.
<Page31>
The first of the two dogs leaps.
Its speed is incomparable to that of a human.
The length of the 20-meter corridor was traversed in no more than two seconds.
<Page32>
The black dog opens its mouth.
Its fangs, like rows of sawteeth, lunge for my throat.
<Page33>
Swift and precise.
The moment I realize it's coming.
The dog's fangs sink into my throat with a wet squelch.
I, Tohno Shiki, have died.
<Page34>
No. That can't be right.
There's no way I could be killed like this, no way I could die like this.
People dying isn't enough to make me hesitate.
――――A hot summer day.
A long time ago. Seven years, to be exact.
At that time, I'm sure I saw a much more vividly gruesome scene than this――――
<Page35>
Stab.
I plunge my knife into the forehead of the black dog that had snapped at the nape of my neck.
The moment its fangs touched my skin, just before it bit into the carotid artery, my arm moved itself automatically.
<Page36>
I'm amazed at myself.
Like a machine whose only function is to slash and kill, I run my blade through the forehead of the dog with no wasted motion.
Because that was where the first dog's 'line' was.
<Page37>
Under normal circumstances, an animal's movement will not stop immediately when its brain is damaged.
Muscles that have already received signals from the brain will execute the last given command for as long as they are able.
<Page38>
So even if I more or less tear its head apart, the dog's fangs will still bite my neck off.
Yeah, well―――under normal circumstances, that is.
<Page39>
However, the dog is 'dead'.
To die is to be stopped. At the moment it was about to kill me, it lost all validity.
<Page40>
The first dog falls to the ground.
In its place, the second dog leaps for my face.
<Page41>
"――――――"
I thrust the knife into its open mouth.
With a stab, the blade burrows itself into its flesh. The dog's outer skin is hard, but its insides are soft. Its bones and flesh are both literally rotten.
<Page42>
But that was a mistake.
This thing's 'line' is not on its face but on its chest.
If I stab it in the mouth, it amounts to no more than a tear in the flesh.
<Page43>
The knife reaches the back of the head from inside the dog's mouth.
Naturally, the hand that holds the knife also ends up inside it.
<Page44>
"――――――Ah"
The dog is still alive.
Its jaws are clamping down.
The cartilage, the soft joint between my hand holding the knife and my arm, will be bitten off at this rate.
The pain finally brings me back to my senses.
<Page45>
"Ah, ah―――!"
You've got to be kidding me...!
What the hell am I doing sticking a knife in a dog's mouth and letting it bite off my arm?
<Page46>
"You――――little......!"
I struggle to pull my arm out.
The intense pain of it being pulverized causes me to see sparks.
<Page47>
It doesn't seem like the dog's fangs will let go.
No, besides that――――The dog is full to the brim with energy even though its head has been pierced.
<Page48>
The dog shakes its body and forcefully positions itself on top of me.
<Page49>
"...!"
I collapse to the floor with a thud.
But I still can't get my arm out.
The dog is pierced by the knife, and yet it still clamps down with its jaws.
<Page50>
"Hee, gh...!"
My arm is being ripped off―――!
I can't believe it. Even if it's a dog, no creature should be able to continue biting in such a condition...!
<Page51>
"Y-You, little......!"
A wet and slimy feeling.
If I look at the dog's mouth, I can see drops of blood spilling out.
<Page52>
Is it coming from the dog's head that was pierced by the knife?
Or is the blood coming from my arm that's getting bitten off?
To be honest, it doesn't matter which it is to my disordered mind.
<Page53>
"Let―――go!"
Even if I try to escape, the dog will still be latched onto my arm.
There's no way I can escape.
There was no way for me to escape in the first place.
I don't have a choice.# I just want to survive. There's only one thing I can do if I want to stay alive.
In other words, all I have to do is kill this thing.
<Page54>
"――――――"
So what do I do?
One of my arms will be torn off in a matter of seconds.
That's the arm holding the knife.
I'm being pushed down.
Even if I can pull my arm out, the black dog will bite at my neck the very instant it gets free.
<Page55>
"―――Heh."
In the midst of this hopeless situation, I let out a humored laugh.
It's okay. First, I need to look at this situation and then carefully think about what to do next.
That's the lesson you've been following all this time, right?
<Page56>
Come on. For example, you can see an abundance of 'lines' behind the dog's head.
As such, it's clear what I need to do in order to survive.
<Page57>
"Ghh――――!"
And yet, why do I hesitate?
This is a violent animal. A beast that devours humans.
But even so, right next to me, suffocatingly close, is a living being with its pulse racing as though on fire.
<Page58>
"Ha, gh―――!"
The force of the bite on my arm grows even stronger.
Stupid. I'm so stupid. I'm being so inconsistent that I should just let myself be killed.
In a world that is kill or be killed,
why do I...
Why do we humans hesitate like it's some sort of cruel act―――
<Page59>
A drop of red blood falls on my face.
It drips down my forehead and enters my eyes.
Dark vermilion seeps into the back of my eyeballs.
<Page60>
"Ah――――"
A vermilion color that scorches my vision.
A hot, thick, nostalgic liquid.
My consciousness goes into a daze.
<Page61>
"...But still, I...
I can't kill something that's alive."
―――How hypocritical.
A person like you has already killed a much greater animal than that lowly beast.
<Page62>
...Ah, you're right.
But that time was different.
I wasn't in my right mind back when I killed Arcueid.
Even when I took down the first black dog, it had nothing to do with my own will.
<Page63>
But now, it is definitely a choice that only I can make.
...Isn't that what Sensei said, Shiki?
That this power can only be used through your own will and no one else's.
<Page64>
That's why.
As long as I am who I am, as long as I continue to be a decent human being, I should respect life and never treat it lightly.
<Page65>
―――But that's also hypocrisy.
Because a long time ago, you already―――
<Page66>
"Ah――――――――"
...A bad dream from my childhood.
<Page67>
―――Come on, what are you waiting for?
<Page68>
...It was a hot summer day.
<Page69>
―――If you hadn't killed him, he would have killed you instead.
<Page70>
...In front of me was the figure of a boy covered in blood.
<Page71>
	―――You already
<Page72>
...The hot red blood on my hands.
<Page73>
	I already killed a person once, didn't I?
<Page74>
"AAAAAAAAAAHH!"
I stab it.
Instead of pulling out my arm, I bury it further into the black dog's head.
<Page75>
A cry of pain echoes in my eardrums.
The black dog's shriek is like the high-pitched scream of a woman. It's howling even though it can't wail properly with my arm stuck in its mouth.
<Page76>
I bet it must hurt a lot.
But it doesn't matter.
I thrust the knife deeper with the bitten arm.
<Page77>
The knife emerges from the back of the black dog's head.
It splits the skull and cuts the skin easily,
spattering sticky gobs of blood and brain tissue everywhere.
Incidentally, my arm holding the knife also completely penetrates the head.
<Page78>
But even with that, the black dog is still alive.
There's only one thing to do.
I reach out my other arm. I rip the knife from my bloody fingers and hold it with my left hand.
The dog's whole body trembles in supplication.
The dog loosens its fangs as if to apologize.
Like I care.# I simply dismantle the black dog along its 'line'.
