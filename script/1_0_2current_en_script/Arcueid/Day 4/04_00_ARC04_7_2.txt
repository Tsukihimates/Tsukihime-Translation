...How suspicious.
The fact that she says she won't break them is extremely suspicious.
<Page2>
"―――I can't allow you to even look.
I got a glimpse of your insane brute strength when we were in that back alley. I can't risk the chance that you end up crushing them with your bare hands."
<Page3>
"What do you mean 'insane brute strength'? It was only natural to use that amount of force given the situation.
Besides, your power would be higher than mine under normal circumstances, and it's not as though I go around breaking things indiscriminately.

As Arcueid says that, she reaches out her hand as though to take off my glasses. Her attitude is more and more suspicious.
<Page5>
Those are the eyes of someone that's definitely up to something.
I move away from Arcueid and sit down on the couch before I can be shown any shocking images.
<Page6>
"Oh, you're running away."
"Of course I'm running. Even though I'm getting used to your recklessness, there's no way I'm handing over these glasses.

Hmph. Fine, I get it. Stingy Shiki."
It seems that she is just curious about things that people hold dear. What is she, a child?
<Page8>
"Alright, fine, I'm stingy. I can't come back to life, so I'm cautious about everything.
...Besides, if I lose these glasses, you can basically say goodbye to us working together. If I get headaches from seeing these lines all the time, who knows what will happen to my mind."
