―――――――――White.
         A dazzling white.
         The color evokes nostalgic memories.
<Page2>
A hot summer day.
<Page3>
A blue sky and a big, big cumulonimbus cloud.
The landscape shimmers in the heat
and the cries of the cicadas make me feel faint.
The sound of cicadas.
Both of my hands are a glossy red, as though they have been splashed with paint.
<Page4>
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
The husks of cicadas litter the open ground.
This space is slowly being burned away,
as though the sun was right next to us.
<Page5>
A hot day in the middle of summer.
It's as if the world has turned into a frying pan.
<Page6>
Uwah... waah...
Uwah... waah...
Uwah... waah...
Akiha is crying.
Akiha, who had always meekly trailed after me, is overflowing with tears.
<Page7>
Apart from Akiha, there is one other child lying on the ground.
The sun's rays bounce across my slick hands.
Ah. These hands...                 are cold.
The collapsed child                 is cold.
The blood spilling out is red.    It's warm.
<Page8>
"Shiki―――――"
The adults are coming.
The collapsed child is dead.
The adults are screaming.
They shout at me, asking me if I had killed him.
<Page9>
―――Even by the standards of something as ephemeral as a dream, the vision I just witnessed was something long gone from my memory.
<Page10>
"Shiki. Come on, wake up.
The sun has already gone down."
<Page11>
My body is being shaken violently.
...An unfamiliar voice, and the feeling of a cold hand on my shoulder.
<Page12>
Arcueid is right in front of me.
It's pitch black outside the window.
I look at my watch and see that it's around eight o'clock in the evening.
<Page13>
"...Huh?"
"Don't give me that 'huh'. I told you to wake me up when the sun goes down, but you just went and fell asleep.
<Page14>
"...Sorry. I guess I fell asleep."
...How pathetic. To think that I fell asleep while looking at Arcueid's sleeping face...
<Page15>
"Seriously. That's totally disqualifying behavior for a guard.
To think that both of us were asleep... You realize that if we had been attacked during that time you and I would have died right?"
<Page16>
"I already told you I'm sorry. But I mean, weren't you the one that said it's safe during the day?"
"You can never know for certain. There are cases like the familiars from this morning after all."
<Page17>
Arcueid is angry.
Of course, it's entirely my fault.
If I fall asleep while I'm supposed to be standing guard, I'm no more useful than a scarecrow.
<Page18>
"And besides, I'm a vampire too, Shiki.
Yet despite this, you were somehow able to fall asleep without feeling any sense of danger. Couldn't at least be a little too nervous to sleep, or struck by a terrible awe, or something like that?"
<Page19>
"―――――――"
...Perhaps the phrase 'entirely my fault' is a bit too far.
This girl seems to be more upset by the fact that I was sleeping peacefully than by the fact that I wasn't on guard duty.
<Page20>
"I wake up after regaining a little of my strength, only to find you happily snoozing away.
You were so defenseless that I was seriously starting to lose faith in my majesty as a vampire."
<Page21>
"What? You were just as vulnerable as I was.
You know, I've already killed you once before. And yet there you were, sound asleep like a princess without any guarantee that I wouldn't do it again. Don't underestimate me just because I'm a human."
<Page22>
I snap back at her, reminding her that a cornered rat will bite a cat.
It was a pretty desperate attempt at an excuse.
