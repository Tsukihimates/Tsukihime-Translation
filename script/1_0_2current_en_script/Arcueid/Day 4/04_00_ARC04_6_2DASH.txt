---------White.
         A dazzling white.
         The color evokes nostalgic memories.
<Page2>
ã€€A hot summer day.
<Page3>
Blue sky and a huge crescent cloud.
The slowly wavering landscape.
and the sound of cicadas that makes me feel faint.
The sound of cicadas.
In my hands, there's a reddish sheen as if paint had been splashed on them.
<Page4>
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
*chirp* *chirp* *chirp*
The husks of cicadas in the square.
The sun seems to be right next to me.
The square is slowly burning.
<Page5>
A hot day in the middle of summer.
It's as if the world has turned into a frypan.
<Page6>
Uwah....waah..
Uwah....waah..
Uwah....waah..
Akiha is crying.
Akiha, who has always been quiet and followed me around, is crying in drops.
<Page7>
There is one other child lying on the ground besides Akiha.
My hands are slippery, and the sunlight is bouncing off them.
Ah. These hands...                 are cold.
The collapsed child                is cold.
The red blood flowing from him     is warm.
<Page8>
"SHIKI-----"
The adults are coming.
The collapsed child is dead.
The adults are screaming.
They wonder if you are the one who killed him.
<Page9>
----I had such a dream, which I have forgotten even in my dream.
<Page10>
"Shiki. Come on, wake up.
The sun has already gone down."
<Page11>
My body is being shaken violently.
......a not-so-familiar voice and the touch of a cold hand on my shoulder.
<Page12>
Arcueid is in front of me.
It's pitch black outside the window.
I look at my watch and see that it's around eight o'clock in the evening.
<Page13>
"............huh?"
"It's not 'huh'. I told you to wake me up when the sun goes down, but you just fell asleep.
<Page14>
"......sorry. I fell asleep."
......it's pathetic. I didn't realize that I fell asleep while watching Arcueid's sleeping face. 
<Page15>
"Seriously. That's no way to be an escort.
We were both asleep, and if we were attacked, we would have died."
<Page16>
"I told you I'm sorry. But you're the one who said it's safe during the day."
"You can never be sure because the monsters can come in like this morning."
<Page17>
Arcueid is angry.
Of course, it's all my fault.
I was supposed to be the one to watch out for her, not the one who sleeps with her.
<Page18>
"And besides, I'm a vampire too, Shiki.
I'm not sure how you can fall asleep without feeling threatened. It's okay to be a little nervous and unable to sleep, or to react with a little fear or respect."
<Page19>
"-------"
........."Totally bad" is an understatement.
This girl seems to be more upset that I was sleeping peacefully than that I wasn't on guard duty.
<Page20>
"When I woke up, I found you sleeping happily.
You were so defenseless that I was seriously starting to worry that you might not have the respect for me as a vampire."
<Page21>
"What? You were just as vulnerable as I was.
I've killed you once before, and I can't guarantee I won't do it again. Don't underestimate me just because I'm human."
<Page22>
I retort like a cornered rat that even bites a cat.
It was almost an agonizing attempt at an excuse.
