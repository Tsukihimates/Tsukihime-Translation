<Page1>
"Well then, it's my turn now.
To tell you the truth, I forgot to ask you something important, too.
"......what? There's nothing to ask me. I'm just a student not a vampire.
<Page2>
"Hmm. Then let me ask you something, Shiki.
How did you kill me?"
"What?"
<Page3>
"I'm asking what sort of tools did you use?
The only magics I haven't experienced yet are the ancient Shintoism of this country and the hidden treasures of South America."
<Page4>
"No, even they can't keep me 'dead' for that long.
Answer me, Shiki. What ancient magic did you use to incapacitate me?"
<Page5>
"No, ancient magic? What are you talking about?"
I can tell that Arcueid is serious.
But I don't understand what she's trying to say at all.
<Page6>
"It's a Conceptual Weapon.
A catalyst for storing history and ideas.
There are magical artifacts in this country too, right? Most of the time, the magic wands, swords, jewels, and masks are used to make magical artifacts, but-- hey, Shiki, are you sure you're not someone from that field?"
<Page7>
"I told you, I'm just a student. I don't know anything about it."
<Page8>
"That's a lie. You can't hurt me if you're not even a mage.
......Shiki, there are things you're keeping from me, aren't you?"
<Page9>
Arcueid glares at me like an angry cat.
But even if she looks at me like that, I have nothing to tell her-----
---wait,maybe.....
<Page10>
"Sorry......I think I may have something.
........but I wonder if it's relevant here."
<Page11>
She is still staring at me.
This is a process that won't stop if I don't open up.
<Page12>
"I don't how to explain it.......but I can see the lines where I can cut things from."
"Lines where you can cut things from?"
I guess so. People usually don't believe me when I tell them this.
In fact, it has always been that way."
<Page13>
"......what does that mean?"
But Arcueid asks back in all seriousness.
<Page14>
"I can see the lines where things can be cut, you know.
It's like a crack, and if you run a blade through it, you can easily cut it.......does this make sense?"
<Page15>
"It's convenient to be able to cut steel with a knife, but it doesn't mean you can cut anywhere you want. You can only cut where you can see the line, so you can't even use it for carpentry.
For example, the time I sliced you......well a knife can cut a woman's skin, right?"
<Page16>
"------"
"........."
A chill runs down my spine.
She looks at me with such a strong gaze that I stop breathing.
<Page17>
"I see. I thought the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception were only a fairy tale, but I guess they do exist.
There are mutant monsters like you."
<Page18>
"I don't need a vampire to tell me that I'm a monster!"
"A monster is a monster, isn't it? No one, not even us, possess the Mystic Eyes that can see the death of things.
<Page19>
"......? The death of things.......?"
"What else could it be?
Shiki. Your eyes must have a connection to a place that should not be connected to any living thing....are those eyes something you were born with?"
"......no, they've been like this for a long time, but they're not innate."
<Page20>
"So you've at least experienced death once before, haven't you?
"It's not so hard to die when you're not a vampire.
......but yes, I have. I almost died in an accident once. It was only after that that I began to see those lines."
<Page21>
"Hmm. I guess the potential was there as well, but I suppose that's what triggered it.......the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.
I'm sure you can kill me with that."
<Page22>
Sniffing unhappily, Arcueid averts her gaze from me.
I'm grateful that she's no longer looking at me with those eyes, although she's clearly disgusted.
<Page23>
"Arcueid......you know what those lines are?"
"Not nearly as much as you can physically perceive, but I can explain it to you in terms of my knowledge."
<Page24>
"What you are looking at is the end result of all things, the spot where things die or to put it more simply, the death itself, the death of all things."
"----"
<Page25>
That's.....
...slightly different, but it's close to what Sensei who gave me these glasses taught me as a child.
<Page26>
........end result of all things. The future of things.
I've been unaware of it, until now.
I tried so hard not to be conscious of it.
<Page27>
"......what are you talking about? The lines I see are just something that cuts right there."
<Page28>
"I'm saying those lines are 'death' itself.
Listen, Shiki, all things come to an end.
When that happens varies from individual to individual, but anyway, there is always an end.
Death is not something that comes, it's something that is included in the moment of birth and will manifest itself someday. It is a matter of cause and effect. You've heard of the law of causality, haven't you?"
<Page29>
"Everything that has a begining has an end. It's the promise of atomic flow and energy. The system will not tolerate a single exception, not even the smallest error.
If such a thing existed, the whole premise of this universe would collapse. It would disappear like a bubble."
<Page30>
No, even if that's true.
Isn't that taking things out of proportion?
<Page31>
"You're missing the point!
Your eyes are the most horrible things I've ever seen!"
"------"
<Page32>
"Listen. Annihilation is a pre-designed rule for all things.
Even the strongest and the longest life has this rule. Even if there is life that has a life span longer than the life span of the universe, it will not live indefinitely."
<Page33>
"This predetermined 'annihilation' is the 'death' of the thing.
And since it's always been there, it's not impossible to see it with your eyes if you have the ability to understand the concept of 'death' and if you have a brain and eyes that are in line with it."
<Page34>
"That's what you're looking at, those lines.
If I were to theorize it in your way, I'd say it's a fatal flaw in the atomic bonds.
Or maybe it's a self-destructive switch in the genes that manifests the cause of the individual's death."
<Page35>
"Anyway, what you're seeing is the line where things die, the conclusion of death itself.
I don't know how you've been able to live all this time in such a state. You must have a very tranquil mind, Shiki."
<Page36>
Arcueid speaks plainly.
"------"
You got to be kidding me, I don't even know what to say.
I understand her explanation, but I don't want to agree with any of it.
<Page37>
"There's no such thing that exists, much less something I can see."
<Page38>
"You can see it.
Normally, if you cut off a creature's head, it is killed. This means that it stopped because it was decapitated.
Conversely, a creature that isn't decapitated won't be killed. #Oh, well, I'm the exception to that rule."
<Page39>
"You can defy that rule.
Even if you are dealing with a thing that nullifies all external factors, you will kill it first and the person who was killed will be 'dead' afterwards.
It's not that you were able to kill it because you severed them.
In your case, you kill the thing, and as a result, the object dies."
<Page40>
"See, if that's not a monster, then what is?
You say it's just a line that can cut things, but those two eyes are more unique than any other ability that has ever been created.
You know, Shiki. You have eyes like the Grim Reaper that can kill everything."
<Page41>
"..................."
......that's right.
So I've been trying not to be conscious of it, and not to acknowledge it.
<Page42>
The truth is that I've known it for a long time.
Arcueid is right, these eyes and this life is nothing but a mistake to the world.
<Page43>
Because ever since that day, I've been shown the end of the world.
I've been shown the possibility that everything could fall apart in a second.
As long as I'm alive, I'm surrounded by it.
There were so many signs of death all around me.
<Page44>
"......so what?
I can kill you too, you know. I can kill anything. I'm a very dangerous person."
"Really? Then let's give it a try."
<Page45>
Arcueid turns off the lights in the room and moves to the window.
The curtains are opened.
A lot of light and a lot of information that were blocked out, come into view.
The moonlight through the window creates a shadow of a white girl.
<Page46>
"Come on, let's get serious.
Oh, are those glasses preventing you from seeing things?"
<Page47>
"It's okay."
......impossible.
I put my hand on my glasses, which I've never taken off in public before.
<Page48>
.....I guess I'm desperate after Arcueid's accusations.
The violent feelings push me to take off my glasses.
<Page49>
Lines start to wriggle around the room.#    #......world gets filled with the death of the end#.
<Page50>
"-----------#Eh?"
It's such a marvel that I can hardly believe my eyes.
<Page51>
Outside the window, there is a white moon.
Lines that are difficult to see during the day due to the strong sunlight,
But in the faint light of the moon, the lines are glowing and can even be seen easily.
<Page52>
Among them.
The "lines" on Arcueid's body are so thin and insubstantial that I have to concentrate my mind to see them.
<Page53>
"...........how?"
<Page54>
"What do you think? The lines are almost invisible, aren't they?
I'm a creature of the night that doesn't have a fixed time of death.
So it would be almost impossible for your eyes to kill me.
<Page55>
"I don't die at night, but in daytime, I can be somewhat mortal.
I was almost killed by you because of this weakness. It was after a big day of work, and my resistance to death was low."
<Page56>
"As a result, you killed me, and as you can see, I grew weaker to the point where I could 'die' at night.
In other words, I'm no longer immortal, but Shiki, can you cut the line on my body?"
<Page57>
"----"
......I wonder.
It's true that if there is a line it can be cut.
But I don't think I'll be able to cut it as brilliantly as I did then, in less than a second.
<Page58>
"I think it will be hard to do.......I can' t do it unless you are asleep, because I can't see the lines clearly."
<Page59>
"See? That's your biggest flaw.
No matter how much you see death, it has to be your own skill that traces the line.
No matter how weak I am, my motor skills are not so weak that you can catch me."
<Page60>
......I see.
If you ask me, I can't keep up with a fast-moving animal and I can't catch it.
I can't even touch the line if I can't catch it.
<Page61>
In other words, even if I can see these "lines," I can't kill anything that moves faster than me.
The non-human thing laughs and says that her fears were only alleviated by such words.
<Page62>
Yes, it's a funny story. It's a comforting joke.
No matter what metaphors I've been taught, no matter what flaws I've been taught, it doesn't change the way I've always seen the world.
I'm a broken part of the world that should not be allowed to mix with it.
<Page63>
Yeah, but still...
It's so easy to take something like that for granted that it becomes unimportant.
I'm seeing things that are impossible to see.
<Page64>
A large flower that bursts in the moonlight.
......that's right. It's not that I want eternity.
I just want to live in hope that there is something I can touch.
I just want to live with hope.
<Page65>
"Ouch."
I feel a headache coming in.
Looking at the lines gives me headache. I put on my glasses and switch from the miraculous scene to my original view.
<Page66>
"..............."
Arcueid is staring at me suspiciously.
<Page67>
".....what is it?....you have something more to say?"
<Page68>
"Well, not really but...
....if you wear those glasses, you can't see the lines?"
<Page69>
"......well, yeah.
It was given to me by a person I met a long time ago when my eyes started acting like this.
Now I only use the lenses, but thanks to them I'm somehow able to lead a normal life."
<Page70>
"I see, you're right.
No matter how strong your mind is, if you face death all the time, you'll either go insane or you will crush your eyeballs.
<Page71>
"......you know what? You've been saying all the right things and making all the noise you can. You need to show a little restraint. Also, you're close. Stop. Just stop right there. I'll throw a vase at you if you don't stop!"
<Page72>
Sensing danger, I back away.
However, there's no way my threats would work on this big cat, and she approaches me, curiously.
<Page73>
"Heyy, that, let me see that."
"No. I'm not giving it to you. It's too important to me."
<Page74>
"I'm not going to break it.
Heyyy, I'm just going to look at it, okay?"
<Page75>
What a stupid idea!
I'm----
C:>taken aback so I hand it over.
C:>not gonna give this to anyone.
