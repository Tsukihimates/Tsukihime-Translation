"I―――"
There's no way that I can say I can't do it.
<Page2>
I killed this person.
As a result, she is weak and in need of someone to help her.
...Plus, I've only talked with her a little bit, but I have a feeling she's not so bad―――
<Page3>
"So, what about it?
For a human like yourself, I guess working together with a vampire is out of the question after all?"
<Page4>
"Of course it is. So you do get it after all."
<Page5>
"――――"
Yeah, so please don't give me that look.
I'll feel so guilty that I won't be able to say no.
<Page6>
"...But there's no way I can turn back now.
My conscience wouldn't let me rest easy if I feigned ignorance about what just happened here."
...It's obvious that I'll regret it later.
But still...
<Page7>
"...Above all, you're dealing with the man who is responsible for the serial killings.
That being the case, as a resident of this city, I'd be remiss if I didn't at least help you."
<Page8>
It's a little better than averting my eyes from her ridiculously head-on stare.
<Page9>
"So that means―――"
"...I don't want to be your shield, but I'll at least stand guard."
"――――――"
<Page10>
...And then there's this.
What is up with that face?
She can die and come back to life, make a tornado with the wave of her hand, and now this. She really is the complete package.
<Page11>
"That's great. With this, we have a deal."
The girl reaches her hand out to me.
<Page12>
"I can finally introduce myself.
I'm Arcueid―――well, it's a bit of a long name, so you can just call me Arcueid.
I'm from the True Ancestor caste of vampires, what sort of human are you?"
<Page13>
I sigh heavily after being subjected to a self-introduction unlike any I had ever heard before.
...It's either a sigh of exhausted resignation, or perhaps acceptance of this unbelievable situation.
<Page14>
"I'm Tohno Shiki. Unfortunately, I'm just a student.
...I already mentioned this earlier, but I really am of no use to you."
<Page15>
I hold that gir―――Arcueid's hand.
She looks at me carefully, and then...
asks me to shake hands with her.
<Page16>
"I look forward to working with you, Shiki.
I'll be sure to have you take full responsibility for killing me back then."
<Page17>
Arcueid smiles and holds out her left hand.
...I'm sure there are many responsibilities in the world, but I'm probably the first and last person to take responsibility by helping the person I killed.
<Page18>
"...Yeah, this really is insane."
But there's nothing else I can do at this moment.
I reluctantly hold out my left hand and shake hands with the girl in white who calls herself a vampire.
