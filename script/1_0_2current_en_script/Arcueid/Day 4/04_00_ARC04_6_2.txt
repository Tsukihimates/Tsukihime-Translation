"...I made a promise after all."
That's right. I've already made a promise.
No matter what happens, I don't think I should break it.
<Page2>
...Arcueid is sleeping.
It really doesn't look like it, but she said that she's weak at the moment.
She said earlier that she was at her limit; in truth, I haven't had a chance yet to think about what I'll do from here... whether I should run, or stay.
<Page3>
The atmosphere has fallen completely silent.
She and I are not just the only two people in the room, but on the entire floor. ...I'll put aside for now the question of whether it is rude to count a self-proclaimed vampire as a person.
<Page4>
"...What am I saying. She's the one that's rude here, dumbass."
I'm giving myself a hard time.
After all the events between this morning's game of tag and now, my body and mind are exhausted to the point where they no longer function properly.
<Page5>
"Anyway, let's calm down first."
I move away from the door to sit down on a chair.
I take a seat on one of the tall chairs at the minibar.
I retrieve a bottle of spring water from the refrigerator, pour it into a glass, and take a few sips.
<Page6>
"―――Alright."
Thanks to the cool water, my mind becomes clearer.
My head is numb from all the unbelievable things that have happened since this morning, but I'm going to stay calm, think things over, and decide what I'm going to do from here...
<Page7>
"............"
"――――――――Seriously?"
This is the second time I've said that today.
The first time was directed toward Arcueid, but this time it's directed at myself.
I can't concentrate because I can hear the sound of the sleeping woman's breathing.
Even for someone as unprincipled as me, there's got to be a limit. Why am I getting so excited about her now, of all times...!
<Page8>
Let's get out of the room for now.
It's probably because I haven't gotten over the fear I felt in the alleyway.
If I take a deep breath in the hallway, I'm sure this strange fever will cool down.
<Page9>
"...We're really renting it all..."
There are no employees on the top floor, let alone other guests.
<Page10>
The room Arcueid is in is a corner room, at the end of the hallway.
It has the best view, but understandably it's also a long way from the elevator hall.
<Page11>
"...Come to think of it, school―――"
It's a little after eleven o'clock. This isn't the sort of truancy you can just talk your way out of.
<Page12>
If the school contacts my home it'll be game over for me, but there's no helping that now.
I wonder what sort of telling-off Akiha would have in store for me... no, there's no use thinking about something I can't change.
<Page13>
"...It's a long shot, but I'll send a text to Arihiko..."
<Page14>
'Feel bad today. Skipping.
Help me out if you can.'
<Page15>
I dash out a rough explanation of the situation and make a request to my close friend.
I'm not asking him to force it, but just slip something in if the chance arises.
I wish I could tell him more about the situation, but...
<Page16>
"No, no. I couldn't do that unless it was a real emergency."
If he were to ask if I had finally lost it, I would be completely unable to make a rebuttal.
This much is more than enough for a guy like him.
<Page17>
"―――Now then."
Thinking about his familiar face has calmed me down.
I resign myself, and return to the room where the self-proclaimed vampire is sleeping.
<Page18>
"...Pardon the intrusion..."
I know I won't get a reply, but I can't resist the force of habit.
On the bed, the woman in white is still sleeping, her appearance entirely unchanged from earlier.
There is no sense of danger. If I didn't know the situation, I would have guessed that she was a princess from a foreign country.
<Page19>
I sit down on the sofa, which I had avoided due to the fear that sitting down would make me unable to get back up again.
The sofa is the only place where I can see both the bed and the door at the same time.
<Page20>
As expected, the comfort of the sofa is incredible.
I feel like I'm going to melt, but I must keep watch. I've got to steel myself and stay on guard while she sleeps.
<Page21>
"......"
Still. Looking at her like this, she really is nightmarishly beautiful.
Her white, smooth-looking skin, her each and every finger a work of art, the gentle curve of her body...
<Page22>
The overall portrait is flawless, and the shape of every little detail is without peer. Never before have I seen such a perfectly sculpted figure.
No, to be more precise,
I never thought I would see something like this in my lifetime.
<Page23>
"......Hah."
I look up at the ceiling in contemplation.
Putting aside the fact that I killed her and she came back to life, or that she is a vampire, Arcueid is an existence that speaks human language and has the form of a human being.
<Page24>
If she is too weak to wake up on her own, then that responsibility falls to me.
"...You have to take responsibility for your own actions."
<Page25>
...The lessons from my childhood appear at a time like this.
I think it was Sensei that said that.
Because I have strange eyes,
I attract strange things as a result.
<Page26>
...As such, I must be prepared for anything.
For now, I have to protect her in my own way, at least for tonight, just as I promised――――
