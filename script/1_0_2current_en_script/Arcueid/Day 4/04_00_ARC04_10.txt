<Page1>
*ding*
A cheerful sound rings out, terribly out-of-place.
"Ele... vator...?"
Another cab arrives right next to the one from earlier.
My exhausted brain cannot comprehend the meaning of it.
<Page2>
The door opens.
Even though my brain is not functioning properly, my body automatically places the knife back in my right hand and stands up to face the tragedy that is about to unfold.
<Page3>
...Ah, I feel sick.
Once again, an iron box opens.
Inside it, there is...
<Page4>
"――――――Nothing?"
There is nothing inside.
<Page5>
...I guess you could call this an anticlimax.
The danger has passed.
It's all over now, but I finally get a grasp on the situation on the lower floors.
Since there's no longer any reason to be here, I turn to go back when―――
<Page6>
"Ah, hah, any, one, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone!"
A comically absurd female voice rings out.
The voice, along with her footsteps, grows louder and louder.
<Page7>
There's no doubt about it.
There is a survivor running up the stairs next to the elevators, gasping for breath...!
<Page8>
"Ha, ha, ha... Thank goodness, it's not burning here...!"
I can hear her cries of joy.
The sound of footsteps does not stop.
The source of the voice tumbles into the elevator hall.
<Page9>
"You! Hey, you over there!"
Noticing my presence in the hallway, the woman begins to run once again.
<Page10>
"Thank goodness, I'm saved...! I'm finally saved...!"
Her face that had been tense with fear begins to radiate joy.
<Page11>
"Eh...?"
A pallid hand appears and drags that hope back into the depths of hell.
"No way...no, no, NOOOOO!"
She stares at me, as her voice continues to beg for help.
<Page12>
There is no resistance at all.
The woman is restrained with ease.
As soon as she's grabbed by those hands, the woman loses consciousness as if she's waking up from a dream.
<Page13>
―――Stop.
―――Stop right there.
―――That woman.#―――She has nothing to do with us,# she's just an innocent woman.//scripted line break
―――Don't feed on her, at the very least.
<Page14>
"Sto―――!"
My plea does not make it in time.
It wouldn't make a difference even if it had.
<Page15>
I stare at the woman's neck.
The light in her eyes goes out.//目の中で星が散るようだ
Unprecedented rage sharpens my vision.
Two bottomless eyes cloaked with bloody resentment.
<Page16>
The woman's limbs twitch softly.
"Ah... aah, ah―――"
Her face shrivels as her emotions and vitality are stolen.
<Page17>
Without a doubt, this is the first time I've ever seen such a scene.
Yet despite seeing it now for the first time, there is no need for an explanation to understand what is taking place.
<Page18>
Even the gulping sounds can be heard.
After a long period of feasting, the man casually discards her body.
The woman falters like a withered tree.
A ballerina dancing narrowly on the brink of death.
On her wretched-looking back...
<Page19>
There are no screams.
Only the sound of bloodshed echoes through the air.
Her pulverized back.
A shower of blood.
The vampire breathes out in satisfaction as he bathes in it.
<Page20>
The world changes drastically.
The apparent temperature finally matches that of reality.
A layer of flame envelops the corridor.
Like a river rushing through a dam.
<Page21>
My skin fizzles and burns.
If I breathe now, my lungs will fry for sure.
<Page22>
But something's strange.
They're burning. The flames are definitely flickering.
And yet the building is not being burned.
The only one that can feel the flames is me, the sole survivor.
<Page23>
I can feel a headache coming on.
The man starts walking toward me.
He is the source of the river of flames.
The closer he gets, the hotter the atmosphere becomes.
<Page24>
He is still 15 meters away.
I'm unable to breathe even at this distance.
In other words, any living thing would be annihilated if they so much as approached this man.
<Page25>
The slim figure walks toward me.
His outfit is eccentric. Elegant, traditional-style clothing cloaked in a barbarian overcoat.
While he has the appearance of a human, it is clear that he is nothing like one.
Everything is out of sync. I'm about to go crazy.
13 meters.
He strides toward me in complete silence.
<Page26>
"―――"
I ready my knife and glare at the man.
No response. I wonder if he can even see me in the first place.
10 meters.
I stare at the man.
Within the midst of the roiling flames, the lines of death come into view.
<Page27>
"―――"
The inside of my skull boils like soup.
<Page28>
What the hell is that?
An intricate, swirling, dense torrent of death.
Shining brightly in the midst of it all like a jewel―――
<Page29>
"Gh...!"
I turn my eyes away from the excessive headache.
That thing is bad news. It would be foolish to continue looking at that point in the man's center.
It's like looking directly at the sun and burning your retinas.
My brain will explode if I look at that thing without being prepared.
<Page30>
8 meters.
The distance is narrowing.
The temperature is rising. But it's still not hot enough to burn my flesh.
<Page31>
6 meters.
The man stops at that distance.
His gaze focuses on me. The man finally notices me at this close range.
<Page32>
―――Our eyes meet.
I shouldn't be making eye contact with him.
The warning of the woman in white comes to mind.
But I can't take my eyes off him.
I cannot ignore the bottomless void in front of me.
<Page33>
That can't be right. This must be fundamentally different from the Mystic Eyes that the woman in white talked about. These eyes don't have the power to paralyze a person. Because they are eyes of madness. They're the eyes of a madman. An ugly and pitiful being that flourishes on his own abnormality and is driven by nothing but his impulses. A bastard just like me―――
<Page34>
"...!"
My instincts tell me I'm in danger.
Alarm bells ring inside my head.
But my body still won't move. Not even a single fingertip responds.
<Page35>
Danger signals ricochet around my skull.
No matter what means or methods I use, I must get away from here immediately, or else my life will come to an end.
<Page36>
―――But it was already too late.
The sickly-eyed man, without even acknowledging my existence,
burns me to death with his 'hand'.
<Page37>
"――――"
I'm dead.
After all, these flames are the real deal.
The blue flames that drench the hallway are just an effect that manifests outside of reality.
Even if I were swallowed by them, it wouldn't be enough to kill me outright. They must be some kind of phantom pain that only scorches the soul.
<Page38>
But this is different.
These flames are real. Just getting close to them will be enough to burn my skin. Life will turn into ash from just a single touch.
Sharp claws of flame lash out at me.
<Page39>
My body will be cut in two at the waist, and burn up as the fire spreads from that cross-section.
An outcome as clear as day.
And yet, just before that―――
<Page40>
My body is yanked backwards, and at the same time a thud reverberates in the hallway.
<Page41>
"―――Arcueid...?"
The sound of utter disbelief escapes my throat.
My thoughts turn blank.
<Page42>
I understand the situation.
I was pulled back by Arcueid, and at the same time, she stepped in front of me and took the blow of that 'hand'.
<Page43>
Her actions make no sense to me whatsoever.
After all, I was the one who was supposed to act as a shield.
So why is she hurting herself in order to protect me...?
<Page44>
"――――!"
Arcueid's face twists in agony.
<Page45>
The flaming hands reach out again and again.
There is no need to pull me back this time.
Arcueid swings her right hand to blow away the flames, just as she did in the alleyway.
<Page46>
But it's not perfect.
The flames aren't fully extinguished, and the dregs scorch her skin.
You're telling me... that even a person like Arcueid can get burned by a direct hit...?
<Page47>
Is the temperature so hot that it's lethal even to her, the woman furthest away from death...!?//Omits the 死の線が極端に少ない
<Page48>
It all happened in under five seconds.
The number of shots fired and intercepted was about ten.
For whatever reason, the man solemnly lowers his arm.
<Page49>
"......"
He stares at Arcueid in silence.
Arcueid glares back at the man in pain, her stomach dyed a deep red.
<Page50>
The man is paying attention only to Arcueid.
He treats me, the knife-wielding guy that she protected, as though I were completely non-existent.
<Page51>
"........."
Steam rises from his mouth.
After expelling a breath like exhaust from an engine, the man reaches under his coat with his left hand.
<Page52>
I hear a faint metallic click.
There's no mistaking it. That was the sound of a blade.
There's a long object hidden under that coat. It must be the one that he used to slash the woman in front of the elevator.
<Page53>
The man moves his legs.
With the blade still hidden under his coat, he tries to take a step toward Arcueid.
<Page54>
"Insolent fool. If thou art not a pig, speaketh thy name.
Or wast thy parents too distemperate to teachest thee the most fundamental of manners?"
"――――――"
<Page55>
The man's legs stop in their tracks.
A flicker of ego stirs in his ghostly eyes.
Arcueid's words were in a language I can't make heads or tails of, but this man seems to understand. // 男はあえぐように喉を鳴らした
His voice sounds pained, as if he had forgotten that he was a living creature until now.
<Page56>
"...I know the formalities.
But, as of yet, I have no name to share with the likes of you."
<Page57>
"You may not have any manners, but it seems that you can feel some shame at least.
So you have lost your original name, huh... but you do have something to be called by, do you not? You may have only recently succeeded to your role, but you still number among the Ancestors."
<Page58>
...The atmosphere changes.
The intensity of the blue flames burning in the hallway skyrockets.
Did Arcueid's words strike some nerve in the man?
<Page59>
"―――Vlov."
With a troubled expression, the flame spreading vampire says,
"Vlov Arkhangel."
With that, the man announces his own name.
<Page60>
"An unfamiliar name. Since I have no record of you, then you must not be a legitimate successor. Could it be that your master destroyed themselves?"
"...Incorrect. My master... I killed them."//Reflowed to match VA
<Page61>
"So that's how you became the new Ancestor.
In that case, did you want the honor of killing me next?"
"...Honor, is something that exists within one's own breast.
I... will take away nothing but the things I desire."
<Page62>
"As admirable as your determination may be, you should have focused that desire on me alone.
This is a bit over the top."
"...No. This city is rotten to the core.
If I do not burn it to the ground, it would go against everything that I believe in."
"Oh really. In other words, you are just like all those other third-rate Dead Apostles then."
<Page63>
"...I am well aware of my crude nature.
Princess of the True Ancestors. That heart of yours, shall be mine."
<Page64>
"...!"
The space around the vampire that calls himself Vlov warps.
The river of flame that pours out from around him increases in magnitude.
Arcueid's body acts as a breakwater, preventing me from being swallowed by the raging torrent.
<Page65>
"...Don't move, Shiki. That flame is his weapon.
If you don't want to be turned to ash, then stay behind me."
<Page66>
As much as I appreciate her advice, I can't help but feel a sense of unease that I can't put into words.
...That's his weapon? Really?
Because after creating such a high-temperature environment, it's as though his true form is like―――
<Page67>
No, now is not the time to think.
I focus my attention and grasp the knife.
<Page68>
―――It's coming.
The hallway is now a cave of fire.
Just as Vlov was about to unleash the blade from under his coat―――
<Page69>
"...Huh?"
―――This happens.
The man turns his back on us all of a sudden.
<Page70>
He walks to the elevators as if nothing had happened, boards one with the same air of composure, and leaves the floor.
<Page71>
"Wha―――"
I don't understand any of this anymore...!
Not the two dogs that attacked me, not the flames that covered the corridor, and not the nightmarish reality that descended on this hotel!
<Page72>
"Shi―――ki."
Arcueid collapses against me with a thud.
...It's a nasty wound. The bleeding from her stomach has stopped, but her face is contorted in pain.
<Page73>
―――It happened just a few seconds ago.
It was the wound she got while protecting me from that man.
<Page74>
"That's right... why, did you...?"
<Page75>
"...Yeah, I underestimated him a bit.
I thought I could save you and still dodge the attack in that situation, but#―――# as expected of you, Shiki.
Those wounds that you inflicted on me were worse than I thought."
<Page76>
With her face still contorted in pain, Arcueid cracks a smile at her own joke.
<Page77>
"――――――"
I can't look at her.
Even though she was wounded while protecting me, even though she was only able to be wounded because of me in the first place―――If she looks at me with that idiotic smile of hers, I don't know how I'm supposed to respond.
<Page78>
Arcueid leans her body against mine and gently closes her eyes.
<Page79>
"Wait a minute, what are you closing your eyes for, you idiot!
Get a hold of yourself. You're supposed to be an invincible vampire at night, aren't you!?"
<Page80>
"...Yeah... but... it seems... that I'm at my limit."
"Wha――――"
"I'm sorry, but I need you to take me back to my room."
<Page81>
Arcueid collapses on me.
I feel the weight of her body as I catch her in my arms.
"―――Wait a minute, you can't be―――"
If you go ahead and die right now, I really won't know how to respond...!
<Page82>
"No, you can't. Wake up, Arcueid...!"
I call out to her as she lies there with her eyes softly shut.
And then.
"...Zzz―"
Her somnolent breathing sounds so happy it makes me feel like an idiot for yelling just then.
<Page83>
"......"
...All my worries melt away.
It seems that Arcueid is just asleep.
<Page84>
"...Hah. Telling me to take you home, just how selfish can you get―――"
But in this case, it can't be helped.
And besides, it's not a good idea to stay in this hotel any longer.
<Page85>
...This was such a tragedy.
Even though none of the abnormal events that happened here were detectable from outside, sooner or later someone will notice.
<Page86>
"......Guh."
The headache won't stop.
My body is also at its limit.
I put on my glasses so that I can at least relieve my headache.
<Page87>
"...Arcueid's room―――Ah, she means that place."
<Page88>
I've only been there once, but I definitely remember it.
There's no point in staying here.
I retrieve my luggage from the royal suite, and with Arcueid in my arms shamefully leave the now vacant hotel.
<Page89>
The sky is getting brighter.
"...I see, so that's what happened."
<Page90>
The reason why the man left was so simple.
The sun had already fully risen over the city.
Before I knew it, the night had already long turned into day.
<Page91>
...In any case, I should let Arcueid get some rest for now.
I decide not to catch a cab.
A suspicious pair like us are bound to be remembered.
<Page92>
I board a bus headed toward Souya Station to get as far away from the hotel as possible.
Fortunately, it's early in the morning so we didn't attract any attention.
<Page93>
The emergency exit at the back of the building was still the same as it was the day before yesterday.
The residents and managers must not have noticed that the lock had been 'cut'.
<Page94>
6:30 AM
Once again, I creep into the room of the self-proclaimed vampire woman. I have a feeling that this long day has come to an end at last.
