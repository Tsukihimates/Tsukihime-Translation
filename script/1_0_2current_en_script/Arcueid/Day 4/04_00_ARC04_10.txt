*ding*
There is a loud sound, terribly out of place.
"Ele......vator......?"
Another box arrives, this one right next to the previous one.
My exhausted brain does not reflect on what it means.
<Page2>
The door opens.
Even though my brain is not functioning properly, my body automatically brings the knife back to my right hand and stood up to face the tragedy that would happen "after this".
<Page3>
......ah, so disgusting.
Once again, the iron box opens.
Inside it, there is...
<Page4>
"------nothing?"
There is nothing in it.
<Page5>
......another disappointment, I guess you could say.
The danger is over.
Even though it's all over, I can see what's going on downstairs.
So there's no reason for me to stay here, I say as I'm about to turn on my Heel.
<Page6>
"Ah, ha, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone!"
The woman's voice sounds inexplicably ridiculous.
The voice grows louder with the sound of footsteps.
<Page7>
There's no doubt about it.
From the stairs of the elevator hall, a survivor comes running up, gasping for breath.......!
<Page8>
"Ha, ha, ha......that's it, it's not burning here......!"
I can hear the shouts of delight.
The sound of shoes never stops.
The source of the voice appears in the elevator hall, running.
<Page9>
"You! Hey, you there!"
She notices me in the hallway and starts running again.
<Page10>
"Thank god, I'm saved.......! I'm saved.......!"
Her face, which was tense with fear, begins to glow with joy.
<Page11>
"What......?"
A pale hand pulls that hope back to hell.
"No.......no, no, no, no!"
The woman begs for help, still looking at me.
<Page12>
There was no resistance.
There was no restraint.
As soon as his hands grab her, she loses consciousness, like waking up from a dream.
<Page13>
---Stop it.
---Stop it.
---The woman. #---She has nothing to do with it, #she's a good person.
---You can't just prey on her.
<Page14>
"Sto..!"
You can't stop it in time.
Even if you reach him, it won't change the outcome.
<Page15>
I stare at the woman's neck.
Stars seem to scatter in my eyes.
My vision becomes clear with unprecedented rage.
Two bottomless evil eyes glowing in rage.
<Page16>
The woman's limbs twitching and twitching.
"......ah, ah---"
The woman's face loses all emotion and vitality.
<Page17>
It must have been the first time she saw it.
but she didn't need to be told what it is.
<Page18>
I can even hear her gurgling.
After he enjoys the woman for a while, he carelessly abandons her.
The woman wavers like a dead tree.
A ballerina dancing on the brink of death.
On her pathetic back.
<Page19>
There were no screams.
Only the sound of bloodshed that echoes through the air.
Her back cracks.
A spray of blood.
The vampire breaths a sigh of relief as he baths in it.
<Page20>
The world changes completely.
The physical temperature and reality finally match.
A film of flame envelops the corridor.
Like a river rushing through a weir.
<Page21>
My skin is burning.
If I breathe now, my lungs will surely be burned.
<Page22>
But something's wrong.
It's burning. The flames are definitely flickering.
And yet the building is not burning.
Only I, a creature, can feel this flame.
<Page23>
I have a headache.
He's starting to walk towards me.
He's the source of the river of flames.
The closer he gets, the hotter the atmosphere gets.
<Page24>
It's only 15 meters now.
Even at this distance I can't breathe.
That means I will die just by getting close to him.
<Page25>
A slender shadow walks toward me.
A strange appearance. Elegant clothes and a savage cloak.
A human form, but clearly not human.
Everything's off. It's crazy.
Thirteen meters.
He's silently coming towards me.
<Page26>
"---"
I stare at him while holding the knife.
No response. I wonder if he can see me in the first place.
Ten meters.
I stare at him.
I see the lines of death in the burning flames.
<Page27>
"---"
The inside of my skull boils like soup.
<Page28>
What is that?
A complex, tangled, swirling, dense torrent of death.
Like a jewel, shining brightly in the midst of it all.
<Page29>
"Hz......!"
I turn away from the headache.
That's not good. It's not good to keep looking at that point "in the middle".
Like looking directly at the sun burns your retina.
My brain will explode if I look at it without preparation.
<Page30>
Eight meters.
The distance is getting closer.
The temperature is rising. But it's not hot enough to kill me yet.
<Page31>
6 meters.
At that distance he stops.
His gaze focuses on me. At this close, the man finally notices me.
<Page32>
---Our gazes meet.
That eye is not good.
The girl in white's warning flashes through my mind.
But I can't make eye contact with him.
But I can't ignore him either.
<Page33>
That's not it. They must be fundamentally different from the Mystic Eyes that the girl in white was talking about. Those eyes don't have the power to bind the person. Because they're the eyes of madness. They're the eyes of a madman. The eyes of a maniacal thing... an ugly, miserable, impulsive thing, a bastard just like me, driven by its own abnormalities.
<Page34>
"......!"
My instincts tell me I'm in danger.
It's not good, my instincts are triggered.
But my body still won't move. Not one fingertip responds properly.
<Page35>
Danger signals bounce around my skull.
No matter what means or methods I use, I must get away from here immediately or my life will be ended.
<Page36>
---But it's too late.
The one with the diseased eyes never pays any attention to me,
He burns me to death with his hands.
<Page37>
"----"
Dead.
Because those flames are real.
The blue flames that wet the hallway are an effect on top of reality.
Even if you are swallowed by it, you will not die instantly. Perhaps it's like a visionary pain that only scorches life.
<Page38>
But this is different.
These flames are real. Just getting close to it burns your skin. Life carbonizes at its touch.
It's released in the form of sharp claws.
<Page39>
My body is cut in two and burns from the severed side.
A certainty clearer than fire.
And yet, just before that.
<Page40>
I was pulled backwards with a thud.
<Page41>
"---Arcueid......?"
The question escapes my throat.
My thoughts went blank.
<Page42>
I know what's going on.
I was pulled back by Arcueid, and at the same time, she stepped in front of me and took that "hand".
<Page43>
That action makes no sense to me.
It was supposed to be my role to shield her.
So why is this person hurting herself to protect me......?
<Page44>
"Ahh----!"
Arcueid's face twists in pain.
<Page45>
The hands of flame reaches out again and again.
There is no need to pull me this time.
Arcueid swings her right hand to blow away the flames, just as she did in the alleyway.
<Page46>
But it's not perfect.
The flames can't be extinguished, and the aftermath scorches her skin.
You can't possibly be saying that a direct hit will burn even Arcueid......?
<Page47>
Are the flames hot enough to lethally burn a girl that has minimal death lines and is so distant from death.
<Page48>
It all happens in just five seconds.
The number of shots fired and intercepted were about ten.
For whatever reason, the man solemly lowers his arms.
<Page49>
"............"
The man stares at Arcueid in silence.
Her belly flushes red as she stares back at the man in agony.
<Page50>
The man only has Arcueid in his sight.
He treats me, who was protected by her and holding a knife behind her, as if I were completely "nothing".
<Page51>
"..............."
Steam rises from the man's mouth.
After a breath as if to exhaust himself, he reaches under his coat with his left hand.
<Page52>
I hear a faint metallic click.
There's no doubt about it. A blade.
There's a long object hidden under that coat. It's probably the one that slashed the woman in front of the elevator.
<Page53>
The man's legs move.
With the blade hidden under his coat, he is about to take a step towards Arcueid.
<Page54>
"Rude one. If you're not a pig, speak your name.
Or were your parents too lazy to teach you even the most basic of manners?"
"------"
<Page55>
The man's feet stop.
His ego lights up in his ghostly eyes.
The man gasps in response to Arcueid's......words, some of which I did not understand.
It's as if he forgot that he was a living being until now, with a voice full of pain.
<Page56>
"......I know the etiquette.
But I do not have a name to tell you yet."
<Page57>
"You have no manners, but you have enough shame.
You may have lost your original name, or......but you still have a name to call yourself, don't you? It may be temporary, but you still inherited it."
<Page58>
......the air changes.
The blue flames that burns in the corridor increase in intensity.
Had Arcueid's words struck a nerve that he could not bear?
<Page59>
""---Vlov.""
The fire-spewing vampire growled in annoyance,
""Vlov Arkhangel.""
He says his name.
<Page60>
"A name I do not know. As I have no record of him, he cannot be the rightful heir. Could it be that my parents destroyed him?
"......that is not true. I am the one who killed him."
<Page61>
"You're the new ancestor.
So now you want to kill me?"
"......honor is what you think of it.
I will only take what I want."
<Page62>
"Your attitude is admirable, but you should limit it to me.
This is a bit much."
"......no. This city is tainted.
If I do not burn it down, it is inimical to my beliefs."
"Oh, yes. In other words, you are a third-rate mortal who's no better than a barbarian."
<Page63>
"I am aware that I am......coarse.
Princess of the True Ancestors. I will take your heart."
<Page64>
"......!"
Vlov. The vampire's surroundings distort as he calls himself that.
A "river of flame" overflows from around him.
Arcueid's body acts like a shield that prevents me from being swallowed by the torrent.
<Page65>
"......don't move, Shiki. This flame is his weapon.
If you don't want to be charred, stay behind me."
<Page66>
I appreciate the advice, but I have an uncomfortable feeling I can't put into words.
......this is his weapon? Really?
Because after creating such a high temperature condition, the main body of that thing looks like...
<Page67>
No, now is not the time.
Concentrate and hold the knife.
<Page68>
---He's coming.
The corridor is now a cave of fire.
Vlov unleashes the blade under his coat right now...
<Page69>
"Huh......?"
---
He suddenly turns his back from us.
<Page70>
He walks to the hall as if nothing happened, gets on the elevator without a care in the world, and leaves this floor.
<Page71>
"Na---"
I don't understand any of this anymore.......!
Not the two dogs that attacked me, not the flames that covered the corridor, not the nightmarish reality that hit this hotel!
<Page72>
"Shi---ki."
With a thud, Arcueid leans on me.
......it's a nasty wound. The bleeding from her stomach stopped, but her face is contorted in pain.
<Page73>
---That was only a few seconds ago.
It was the wound she got while defending me from that guy.
<Page74>
"Yeah...... you, why......?"
<Page75>
"......Yes, I underestimated him a bit.
I thought I could save you and get away with it if I had to #...# As expected of you, Shiki.
Your scratch doesn't look so good, Shiki."
<Page76>
Arcueid smilea jokingly, her face contorted in pain.
<Page77>
"------"
I can't watch.
I don't know what to say to her when she gives me that stupid smile.
<Page78>
Arcueid leans her body against mine and tries to close her eyes.
<Page79>
"Wait a minute, what are you doing closing your eyes, you idiot!
You're a vampire who doesn't die at night, aren't you?
<Page80>
"......yeah......but......I'm kind of..at my limit."
"Now----"
"I'm sorry, but you have to take me back to my room."
<Page81>
Arcueid collapses.
Her weight falls on my arm as I hold her.
"---Wait a minute, no..."
If you die right now, I really won't know what to give back to you.......!
<Page82>
"No, wake up, Arcueid.......!"
I call out to Arcueid, who queitly closes her eyes.
And.
"......koo."
I can hear her sleeping so happily that I feel foolish for having said that a second ago.
<Page83>
"............"
......I was so worried that I lost it.
Apparently Arcueid is just asleep.
<Page84>
"......sigh.. 'Take me to the room', don't give me that selfish order..."
But in this case, it can't be helped.
In the first place, it's not good to stay in the hotel any longer.
<Page85>
......it's such a tragedy.
Even if no abnormalities are leaked outside, sooner or later they will be known.
<Page86>
"............ggh."
The headache won't stop.
I'm at the end of my rope.
I'm going to put on my glasses to atleast ease the headache.
<Page87>
"......Arcueid's room...ah, that place."
<Page88>
I've only been there once, but I definitely remember the place.
Then I shouldn't stay long.
I retrieved my luggage from the royal suite, took Arcueid in my arms, and left the empty hotel with a sense of shame.
<Page89>
The sky is getting brighter.
"......I see, so that's what happened."
<Page90>
The reason why the man left was this simple.
The sun was already fully up in the city.
Before I knew it, night had long since fallen.
<Page91>
......anyway, I should let Arcueid rest for now.
I can't get a cab.
I'm sure he'll recognize these two shady characters.
<Page92>
As far away from the hotel as possible, I boarded a bus bound for Sohya Station.
Fortunately, it was early in the morning and we did not attract any attention.
<Page93>
The emergency exit at the back of the building was still the same as the day before yesterday.
The residents and the janitor must not have noticed that the lock was "broken".
<Page94>
6:30 AM
I creep into the room of the self-proclaimed vampire girl, just as I did the day before, and finally realize that the long day is over.
