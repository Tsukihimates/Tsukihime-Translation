<Page1>
"Ah――――"
Just as expected. Arcueid looks shocked, as if she has only now considered the possibility.
<Page2>
"I guess you're right, now that you mention it.
I wonder why. For some reason, I felt like I could trust you when we talked in the back alley."
"――――――"
...Well, it's not like that's bad or anything.
<Page3>
"...I see. If you really trust me that much, then I'll also make an effort. All I have to do now is keep an eye out, right?"
<Page4>
"Yeah. At least until the sun comes up.
I won't be leaving this room, so I want you to be on guard against anyone that comes to this floor."
<Page5>
"......Right."
You say 'on guard', but it's not as though I'll be much use if something like the black panther from this morning appears.
I'm painfully aware that this sort of responsibility is well beyond my capabilities, and simply saying 'roger that' isn't going to suddenly make me fit for guard duty.
<Page6>
...Let's step back for a second and examine what we know before going any further.
We need to have some way of dealing with things like the black panther or the burning corpses, but I still don't know very much about Arcueid or her enemies.
<Page7>
"I'd like to confirm something, Arcueid.
Those things that attacked us in the alleyway, were they sent by your enemy?"
<Page8>
"I wouldn't say they were 'sent' by him so much as being 'on patrol'.
I'm guessing their role was to follow a certain route in order to monitor the city. Since we were chatting in a location along their patrol route, it seems the end result is that my presence has been discovered."
<Page9>
"When you say 'discovered', you mean by your enemy?"
"Yes. If I'd been in perfect condition this would have saved me a lot of trouble, but with things as they are I'm the one who's vulnerable.
That's why we ran all the way here. If they attack me before I regain my strength, there will be nothing I can do."
<Page10>
So in other words, Arcueid's enemy, the serial killer wreaking havoc in the city―――is another vampire just like her.
Based on this conversation, it sounds like these vampires are searching for each other's 'whereabouts'.
<Page11>
However, their positions are not the same.
That's because right now, Arcueid has become fatally weak.
<Page12>
"Plus, this enemy has subordinates to do their dirty work for them, but you on the other hand have no one to rely on, is that right?"
'Hmph', grumbles Arcueid as she scowls in dissatisfaction.
<Page13>
Judging by her lack of reply, I guess she really is alone...
Well, I guess it's better for me that way―――
<Page14>
"You said earlier that each vampire has their own individual differences. That's what we're talking about right?
In that case, how would you describe the sort of 'vampire that has many allies'?"
<Page15>
"...That's...
...Hmm, how can I explain this simply..."
<Page16>
Arcueid casts her eyes around the room as she tries to think of something.//Weird JP phrase - see https://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/9805870.html
It seems like she's not used to talking with people like this.
<Page17>
"It's fine, just give me the complicated version. Anything you can tell me would be useful, so just say what's on your mind.
I don't know what's going on, but I'll try to figure it out as best as I can."
<Page18>
"Really? Thanks a lot, Shiki."
"Right, sure. No need for thanks so please continue."
'Okay', murmurs Arcueid as she nods meekly.
<Page19>
"When it comes to vampires with many allies, there are several different types, but the Dead Apostle that lurks in this city belongs to a more traditional class of vampire."
<Page20>
"To use the Church's terminology, it would be a 'Castle Lord' vampire.
Castle Lords invade towns and villages through a series of stages."
<Page21>
"For starters, we have Stage 1.
The vampire first finds humans with superior abilities and turns them into servants by sucking their blood.
Humans that have their blood sucked by the vampire die and become puppets of the Castle Lord, but they still retain the personality they had when they were human.
In other words, a 'corpse with a personality'. Ranked against the other Dead Apostles, these undead are the third lowest tier, about equal to an Upper Mage."
<Page22>
Great. I can't follow any of this at all...#!
But at the very least, this clears up my drowsiness.
I'm just going to skip over the words I don't understand and ask about the parts that I do.
<Page23>
"...A 'corpse with a personality'... does that mean they are vampires that are still human?#"
"Perhaps it's better to refer to them as Rank III vampires.
Although their body has surpassed that of a human, think of them as commanders of the worker ants that are unable to reproduce."
<Page24>
"Then what about those things that appeared in the alleyway...?"
"Those things are one rank below. A Rank II 'Ghoul'.
Vampires that are unable to mimic humans, and are workers that simply do as they're told."
<Page25>
Arcueid seems to have warmed up to the topic, and is illustrating the various ranks of vampire.
...How incredibly versatile, this woman.
<Page26>
"Once the vampire has made a certain number of the townspeople into their servants, they then prepare a coffin and go to sleep.
Castle Lords can't go out and about during the day. Simply being active at all would draw attention. Instead, it is up to their servants to stockpile food and expand their influence."
<Page27>
"And so, servants that are Rank III and above blend in with society and gradually prey on other humans.
Human flesh and blood are also a source of nutrition for servants, but most of it is sent to the Castle Lord.
The Castle Lord accumulates power as they sleep in their coffin, eventually turning the entire community into their own flesh and blood.
―――That is the nature of the vampire that lurks in this city."
<Page28>
"At the moment, they don't have all that many servants and so they're not that formidable. However, as the number of victims increases, so too does the power of a Castle Lord.
I was hoping to find their coffin and kill them before that could happen, but I still have yet to locate the enemy's resting place.
This vampire has hidden themselves very skillfully. I can't sense their presence at all."
<Page29>
"If I could only find out where they're sleeping, dealing with this vampire would be a piece of cake.
This time I had no lead whatsoever, so I had no choice but to walk around the city in the daytime to investigate.
And then, I was attacked by a passing serial killer, which was quite troublesome!"
<Page30>
She claps her hands together, smiling at me.
It seems that she's taking a dig at said passing serial killer. How uncomfortable.
<Page31>
"...I see. I think I'm starting to get the picture.
So a monster that preys on humans built a nest in this city, and you're here to exterminate it.
But while you were looking for its hiding place, that's when you were, well, attacked by me. And because you're weak now, you need to hide until you recover... did I get that right?"
<Page32>
"Yeah, I guess that about sums it up."
"Then next question. Why would the enemy go through all this trouble in the first place?
Wouldn't it be easier to just do it all by yourself without creating these servants?"
<Page33>
"To put it simply, it's because they're weak.
No matter how much supernatural power they have, or how large their scope of existence is, vampires cannot survive on their own.
They have many weaknesses, and can never stay in the spotlight for too long.
Instead, they use humans who are frail but have fewer weaknesses, to gather blood from a safe distance. In other words, risk aversion."
<Page34>
"So they have a lot of weaknesses... what are these weaknesses exactly?"
"Sunlight and magic depletion for the most part. But as for their biggest weakness, I would say...
They have a lot of enemies, or something like that."//ruby dots <敵|・><が|・><多|・><い|・>
"They have a lot of enemies...? You mean people like you?"
<Page35>
"I'm an exception. Or should I say, a special case.
Vampires, you see, are hated by humans. Humanity's greatest weapons are their sheer numbers and cooperation, right?
There are also groups of humans that come running any time vampires start causing trouble somewhere in the world, with the goal of killing the vampires responsible."
<Page36>
"The Church is particularly insidious and tenacious when it comes to this... especially the heresy hunters from Western Europe. These agents that profess to carry out the will of the Lord proclaim themselves 'Executors'.
They are humans who have honed their skills at killing Dead Apostles for hundreds of years. Compared to a lower vampire, these guys are much more of a nuisance."
<Page37>
"That's why vampires try to lay low for a while. If they had to deal with the Church all the time, they wouldn't be able to gather enough blood. Plus, more importantly, they'd run the risk of being sealed."
<Page38>
"........."
Heresy hunting... is it like the witch hunts and inquisitions of the middle ages?
These hunters must be real anti-vampire specialists if the vampires feel the need to go into hiding.
However...
<Page39>
"...'Lay low for a while'... then does that mean there's no need for them to hide once they collect a lot of blood?"
<Page40>
"That's right. There's no need to hide once they have enough power.
At that point, even if the Executors were to come it would be too late. The vampire would use the power they accumulated in that town to wreak as much destruction as they possibly can.
Once they have completely devoured the city, they would then move on to find a new hunting ground."
<Page41>
"If humans want to exterminate vampires, they must be aware of these incidents before they happen. By the time vampiric activity is visibly evident, that town will already be rotten to the core.
I'm sorry for putting it like this Shiki, but with this many servants already roaming around, this city is in a situation that cannot be recovered from by human efforts alone."
<Page42>
"........."
Arcueid's explanation goes in one ear and out the other.
I understand what she's saying.
But accepting it is a whole different story.
<Page43>
Even if she says that it's too late to save our city, there's no way I could just say 'Oh, okay' and accept it like that.
And besides, in the first place―――
<Page44>
"...Yeah. As I thought, I can't believe this after all."
"Nngh. What, are you saying that I'm lying to you?"
<Page45>
"No, that's not it. I know that everything you just said is true. You're not the type to lie, right?"
"Of course I'm not. There's no reason for me to lie in the first place."
<Page46>
"Like I said, it's not that I don't believe you, it's that I don't understand these so-called 'Vampires'.
You keep repeating the word 'Vampire', but it still doesn't make sense.
...I know that you're not human. That I'm confident of.
But even so, I can't bring myself to recognize that these vampires exist."
<Page47>
"I guess I see where you're coming from.
After all, the vampires that you imagine are completely different from the ones I'm talking about."
<Page48>
"...Yeah. That's exactly what I mean.
Rather than me questioning whether vampires really exist or not, it's more that I can't comprehend that this is their true nature.
Even the traditional type you talked about makes me feel hopeless. I don't even know the difference between you and them."
<Page49>
...That's right.
Without knowing how she's different, I shouldn't talk with her any more than I already have. I can't continue to blindly trust her.
I mean, there is a possibility that this person is even more dangerous than that Castle Lord vampire.
<Page50>
"I see... I guess that makes sense from a human's perspective.
They'd both look equally dangerous if you can't tell the difference."
<Page51>
"In that case, allow me to introduce you to yet another special lesson!
This time, we'll cover Vampires 101: Fundamentals!"
<Page52>
Arcueid is proudly holding her finger aloft.
"...I'm okay with that. But what the hell do you mean by 'Vampires 101'?"
<Page53>
"You're still a novice after all, so we'll have to start with the things even a kitten could understand, wouldn't you agree?
That's why it's called 'Vampire Fundamentals'. Don't worry, as your senpai I'll be sure to teach you properly."
<Page54>
Who are you calling senpai? ...And besides, you already started explaining the fundamentals. This woman...
<Page55>
"...Hah. Fine. At the very least, try to keep it short, alright?"
"Leave it to me. I'll do my best."
<Page56>
I find it hard to believe an answer like that.
I already said something like this earlier, but it seems that Arcueid is not used to having conversations.
<Page57>
...Well, she does call herself a vampire, so maybe she's never had a chance to talk to a human before.
<Page58>
I look at my watch and see that it's just before midnight.
I'm surprised that it has already been that long but, fortunately, I have plenty of time.
