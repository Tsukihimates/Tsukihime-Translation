I went to the second floor lobby again.
The Tohno residence is divided into the east wing and the west wing with the lobby at the center.
<Page2>
If I were to give a comparison, it would be like a bird with its wings spread.
The lobby is the body of the bird, and the east and west wings are the wings.
One wing ...... is about the size of a small hospital.
It was symmetrical, and I remember that the east and west wings had the same number of rooms.
<Page3>
"Shiki-sama, your room is this way."
<Page4>
Hisui, without going down the stairs, walked down the corridor in the lobby atrium towards the west wing.
Apparently, my room was on the second floor of the west wing.
<Page5>
The sun had already set outside.
A blue carpet#stretching the corridor.
White walls reminiscent of castle walls.
A girl in a maid's uniform was walking down this corridor while being bathed in warm orange lights.
<Page6>
"......looks like a fairyland."
Those words naturally came out of my mouth.
<Page7>
"Shiki-sama, do you have any questions......?"
"No, I'm just talking to myself, don't worry about it."
"............"
Hisui looked at me, then bowed and started walking again.
<Page8>
"............"
......I'm speechless.
I wonder how many times I've been speechless since coming here.
<Page9>
The floor was made of teak, which is considered a high-grade wood.
The ceiling was as high as three meters.
The room in the back is probably a private sunroom.
The room that Hisui led me to was not by any stretch of the imagination the kind of room a high school student would live in.
<Page10>
"......Is this my room?"
"Yes. If you are dissatisfied, we can arrange a different room for you."
<Page11>
"No, I'm not dissatisfied, but it's---"
I think it's a bit too good for me.
<Page12>
"Shiki-sama?"
"It's okay, it's nothing.
I'll be happy to use this room."
<Page13>
"Yes. The room has not been altered in seven years, so there should be no inconvenience.
"............"
Well, I mean...
<Page14>
"......Wait a minute.
This used to be my room seven years ago?"
"That is what I have heard. Was it not?"
<Page15>
Hisui tilted her head faintly.
......I'm relieved.
It seems that this girl can show a certain level of emotional expression.
<Page16>
"Hmm...... well, if you ask me, yeah.
I remember some of it, and I'm sure I did live here."
<Page17>
This room doesn't feel familiar at all but that maybe beacause I'm coming here after 7 years.
<Page18>
"But I still feel uncomfortable. I've been living in a four-and-a-half-mat room until this morning, so it's like I've come to stay in a fancy hotel."
<Page19>
"I understand how you feel, but please get used to it.
You are the eldest son of Tohno family from today."
"......Well, yeah, that's true. I'll try my best not to be laughed at, at least in appearance."
<Page20>
I put my bag on the desk and straighten my back.
It's going to be nerve-wracking, but I'll just have to get used to it.
At least I should be able to relax in this room.
<Page21>
"Also, all the luggage that arrived last night has been brought in, is there any problem with it?
"No, not really.
Oh, is there something I'm not allowed to bring in?"
<Page22>
"......No, it seems that your luggage is too small.
If there is anything you need, we can prepare it for you so please let us know.
<Page23>
"......I see. No, I don't have anything missing for now.
I don't have much luggage to begin with. The only things I have in my luggage are that bag, these glasses, and......."
<Page24>
The textbooks in my bag and the white ribbon I've kept for a long time are all I have.
<Page25>
"Anyway, don't worry about my luggage.
A nice room like this is more than enough."
"......As you wish,
I'll call you in an hour."
<Page26>
"An hour from now, is it dinner?"
"Yes. Until then, please make yourself at home."
<Page27>
Hisui said that with an expressionless face.
But how should I pass the time here?
<Page28>
The clock struck six in the evening.
Normally, I would be in the living room watching TV or using a cell phone, but I seriously doubt that this house has a "casual gathering space".
<Page29>
"Hisui, let me ask you a trivial question.
Does this house have a television or Wi-Fi?"
<Page30>
"A television and Wi-Fi......?"
<Page31>
Hisui narrowed her eyes faintly.
It's a question that...... makes my head hurt, even though I said so myself.
I think it's wrong to ask whether there are basic modern entertainment in such a luxurious western building.
<Page32>
"There are no such things in the living room....... There is an entertainment room in the west wing, but it's locked.
Those relatives who stayed here until the other day brought their personal belongings, but they took everything with them when they left, so there is nothing left."
<Page33>
"The relatives that Akiha kicked out.... who was staying there and for how long?"
<Page34>
Kugamine-sama's eldest son and his family occupied three rooms in the west wing on the first floor.
And the third daughter of the Touzaki-sama and her fianc√© occupied a corner room in the west wing on the second floor.
Kishima-sama's eldest son took a room in the east wing on the first floor.
They all lived there for about three years.
Other than that...... I heard that Makihisa-sama's doctor was staying at the house.
<Page35>
"For three years? ......Hey Hisui. Isn't that what they call freeloaders rather than guests?"
<Page36>
Hisui didn't answer.
It seems that no matter what kind of people were staying here, as a servant, she couldn't give her personal opinion.
<Page37>
At any rate, it seems that the people who were staying here have moved out with their belongings. In that case, I'd better not expect that they left any souvenir behind.
It is unlikely that Makihisa, who disliked modern entertainment as snobbish, would have allowed people to use TV and internet freely.
The same goes for Akiha, who was disciplined by Father.
<Page38>
"---It's not as if I'm going to die without it."
And I have my phone anyway.
I take my phone out of my pocket and check the time and network.
<Page39>
As a matter of course, the signal is still there.
I was relieved to know that I had at least a minimal internet connection at hand.
......I don't know, it just seemed more natural to be out of range in such an unrealistic house.
<Page40>
".................."
In the meantime, Hisui remained silent.
As the epitome of a servant, Hisui does not say anything except what is necessary and what is asked of her.
<Page41>
As a person who is not used to a maid, I felt uncomfortable with her doing so.
I'd like to somehow make her laugh, but it seems like it would be difficult to do so with half-hearted effort.
<Page42>
"I remember there was a stack of books in the west wing of the first floor.
I'll see what I can find there when I'm free."
<Page43>
Hisui did not answer.
Her gaze, which had been fixed on me, has shifted slightly, and she is staring at nothing in the air. Like a cat.
<Page44>
"---Hisui?"
Hisui did't say anything.
And then, suddenly, she looked straight back at me.
<Page45>
"I think it's in Nee-san's room."
"What?"
......I raised my voice abruptly........
Well, I mean, it's...
<Page46>
"I''m talking about the TV
I remember seeing it in Nee-san's room once."
Hisui said, as if recalling the events of a few years ago.
<Page47>
"Good, there's at least that much here.......  Wait a minute.
When you say "Nee-san" do you by any chance mean Kohaku-san?"
<Page48>
"Yes. Nee-san and I are the only two people currently working in this house."
<Page49>
......They look very much alike.
Compared to the girl in the kimono, who was smiling all the time, the girl in the maid's uniform was so expressionless that I could not connect the two as sisters.
<Page50>
"I see. I see. She definately looks like the kind of person who would watch a variety show."
However, I didn't feel comfortable going to her room to asking her to let me watch TV.
<Page51>
"I'm sorry, please pretend this never happened.
I'm going to live here from now on, so I have to follow the rules of the house."
<Page52>
First of all, I wondered what kind of sarcastic remarks Akiha would make if I was leisurely watching TV on the day I came back.
I'll be a diligent student here, as befits a member of the Tohno family.
<Page53>
"I'll stay in my room until dinner, so please call me when it's time. You have other things to do, don't you?"
<Page54>
Hisui nodded yes and put her hand on the doorknob.
The door swung open with a faint creak.
Hisui bowed and then quietly left the room.
