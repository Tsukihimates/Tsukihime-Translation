......let's kill some more time.
There's no need to rush out of school.
It's not as if the situation is going to improve if you hurry every single minute or second.

I stroll around the school without any purpose.
There are almost no students in the building or in the school grounds.
It's fortunate that I don't see any familiar faces, but it's a bit eerie that a place that should be popular is so quiet.

"...... Speaking of which..."
As I look at the empty school grounds, I remember an incident from my junior high school days.
It was a snowy winter's day, and I was walking home across an empty school grounds.
I heard a noise in the storeroom, which was supposed to be empty, and when I stopped by to see what was going on...

"Hello. Are you a second-year?
I'm sorry, but can you please stay out of the school grounds after school?"
<Page5>
An upperclassman I didn't know called out to me.
It seemed that I had somehow stepped into the school grounds before I knew it.
<Page6>
"I'm sorry, I was just going for a walk. I'll be more careful in the future.
I apologized for my carelessness and left the grounds.
<Page7>
"Were you not going home?"
"...... No, I'm leaving now. Thank you for your concern.
I thanked the upperclassman and left the school grounds.
<Page8>
It was a good excuse to make a decision.
If I stayed in school any longer, I would look suspicious.
Let's go back to the classroom, collect my bag, and return to my "real home" this time---.
