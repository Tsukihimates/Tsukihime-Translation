...... I watch the crowd in front of the station in a daze.
It's a little past two in the afternoon.
The bustle of the city continues.
Many people are passing by.
I don't know their names or who they are, but each of them are heading for their own destination without looking at the person walking next to them.
<Page2>
Even though there are so many people in the same place, everyone has only one view.
Just as I am my own main character.
They are having a day in which they are the main actors.
<Page3>
Each day they are visible, but they see nothing.
Each day does not intersect and does not branch out anew.
<Page4>
The wisdom to obtain the minimum amount of "peace of mind" with the minimum amount of effort.
Necessary but uninvolved individualism seems to be the path chosen by humans.
<Page5>
"..............."
I'm feeling sentimental because of my fever.
"...... Let's go home."
My mood has calmed down, and staying here will only make me indulge in strange thoughts.
<Page6>
I sit up from the bench and join the crowd.
With my thoughts dulled by anemia, I head for the mansion.
For now, I just wanted take off my glasses, close my eyes, meditate, and be just like an organ that can only breathe in a room that no one would visit.
@g --- Until I crossed paths with that woman.
<Page7>
"------"
@g I thought that time had stopped.
@g Everything in me will remember that moment, like I was sucked in.
<Page8>
@g ---Boom.
@g Golden hair and red eyes.
@g White clothes. White shadows.
@g A snowfield with no footprints.
@g An unblemished silhouette, reminiscent of a sacred mountain beyond human comprehension.
<Page9>
@g ---Boom.
@g Rising pulse.
@g Fluctuating rate.
@g Veins and arteries activate.
@g The nerves split one after the other, and the spinal cord heats up.
<Page10>
@g If I'm saying I was admiring her, I was definitely obsessed.
@g My feet have already stopped.
@g I look back at the shadow of the woman who has passed out of sight, trying not to lose sight of her.
<Page11>
"---,---------"
@g I find myself forgetting to breathe.
@g I feel nauseous.
@g I can't breathe.
@g I'm suffocating.
@g I just can't remember how to breathe properly.
<Page12>
"---,---------"
@g My throat is burning.
@g My eyeballs feel like they're going to shatter.
@g My palms are wet and slippery.
@g My blood is running low, and my fingertips are so cold I can't feel them.
@g I'm sweating so much.
<Page13>
@g I remember that earth is alive.
@g My breathing restarted on its own.
@g But the reason for that is that
<Page14>
         I didn't make any mistakes.
         I didn't choose anything.
         I just wanted to go home.
<Page15>
@g Reason.
@g I vaguely realized that the tightrope I'd been tricked into walking has now been cut.
<Page16>
"Haa ---- haa ----- haa ----"
@g ...... I have to chase her.
@g I have to chase that woman.
@g Chase, chase, chase, and then talk.
@g Move your frozen feet.
@g Breathe hotly, like ■■■■.
@g Seeking the figure of the white woman.
<Page17>
"Haa ---- haa ---- haa ----"
@g The woman is walking slowly.
@g She's not interested in me at all.
@g --- A faint question flashed through my mind.
@g Not interested? That's absurd. She's such an idiot. But the fact is, I'm not even aware of it. After something. Maybe after something. She's probably very tired. Exhausted. Drained. That's why there is an opportunity. The reason I feel this way is because I'm confident that I can ■ her.
<Page18>
@g@bI want to lick her like she's laughing at me.
@g When was the last time I satisfied my desire.
@g@bI want to tear it apart as I seek it.
@g Not at the cost of masturbation or intercourse, but in a simpler, more primal way.
@g@bI want to tear it down as I taste it.
@g I don't remember. In the first place, I'm still
@g@bI'm still dying to follow my heart.
@gI don't remember that first time.
<Page19>
@g I let out a feeling that didn't seem to belong to me.
@g I clutched my chest to hold back the boiling emotions.
@g The woman swimming in the crowd was pure and beautiful, tasteful and pleasant.
<Page20>
"-------"
@g My throat is aching.
@g I can't get it out of my mouth at all.
@g What's wrong with that? It's only natural.
@g It would be rude for a creature not to get excited after seeing such a sight.
<Page21>
@g I take the thing out of my bag.
@g I put it in my pocket and walk.
@g I feel the touch of iron on my fingertips.
@g What luck.
@g The tools are just perfect.
<Page22>
@g Wonderful. I'm coming. What a sensual encounter.
@g Keep a good distance.
@g Don't be noticed.
@g Don't let anyone around you get in the way.
@g Me and that woman are strangers.
@g So I have to follow the scent as naturally as possible.
<Page23>
@g The woman is entering an apartment.
@g The glass automatic door. The security is perfect.
@g You can't even enter the hall unless you're a resident.
@g Go around to the emergency exit, take off the jacket and put it in the shade. Switch off. And go inside.
<Page24>
@g There's no one in the hall.
@g Look at the elevator. The lamp has stopped at the top floor.
<Page25>
"------"
@g Press the call button. Go inside.
<Page26>
@g Immediately, I'm horrified by the presence of it.
@g My mouth hangs agape at the residue of the woman's scent.
<Page27>
@g I'm excited.
@g In the tight confines of the room, I clutched the object in my pocket.
@g She's right next to me.
@g I can do her in just a few more seconds.
<Page28>
@g I'm getting out of the elevator.
@g I know there is no one in the hall.
@g Out of the locked room. Head for the hallway. No one in sight.
@g No idea.
@g There's only one word my brain can produce.
<Page29>
@g  Woman.
@g  That woman.
@g  I'm going to------
<Page30>
@g  I'm in front of room number three.
@g This must be it. All the other rooms are empty. Can you be sure? I can. That kind of sense of smell, if you're alive as an animal, you've got it whether you want it or not. I just forgot about it in my lazy existence. It's shameful. Unforgivable. There's nothing I can do about it. The rules of civilized society are so gentle and unharmful that such a trivial impulse can turn fatal.
<Page31>
"---,------"
@g I tried to press the doorbell, but stopped.
@g My glasses are in the way.
@g I can't do anything with them on.
<Page32>
"Got it?
Don't ever look at anything thoughtlessly, okay?"
<Page33>
"........."
@g There was a woman who told me that a long time ago.
@g I can't remember her name or face now.
<Page34>
@g I slowly take off my glasses.
@g The swirling lines look like aging wrinkles.
<Page35>
@g I don't know what I'm doing.
@g What am I trying to do?
@g Why am I doing this?
@g What do I want to do with the woman?
<Page36>
@g I don't know.
@g I don't know, but I press the bell.
<Page37>
"Yes..."
@g A voice came through the door. The door opens.
@g In a moment.
@g I slipped into the room through the small gap.
<Page38>
"Wha----"
@g A woman's voice rang out.
@g I tried to step in.
@g I've never heard such a woman's voice, such an obsession, such a longing, in all my life.
@g Before I knew it, the whole thing was over.
<Page39>
@g The moment I entered the room, I heard the sound of a hammer falling.
@g The sound of the door. A creak in my brain. The alarm bell of the end.
@g None of them do. So then, what is it?
@g  Needless to say, there is only one way to do it, 
@g  Nothing else but a knife unleashed.
<Page40>
@g At that moment, I go through the lines running on the woman's body.
@g stab.
@g cut
@g through.
@g run through.
@g cut it into chunks.
@g murdered to perfection.
<Page41>
@g A total of seventeen lines on the body.
@g neck, back of head, right eye to lip, right upper arm, right lower arm, right ring finger, left elbow, left thumb, middle finger, left breast, ribs to heart, stomach to abdomen in two places, left groin, left thigh, left shin, left toe, all of them.
@g passing through each, without taking even a second.
@g In truth, in the blink of an eye, all of it.
I dismantled her into seventeen pieces of meat.
<Page42>
"---Huh?"
I hear a stupid, weak voice.
I didn't realize that it came out of my throat.
<Page43>
I feel lightheaded and dizzy.
There are pieces of something scattered in front of me.
On the marble floor, a red liquid spreads out like an overturned bucket of water.
The smell of blood is revolting.
The cuts are very clean, no guts have been spilled out.
<Page44>
Only the red color invades the floor like a wave.
It is strange.
There is nothing in the room, just the dismembered limbs of the woman and myself standing here.
<Page45>
"What the..."
The red erosion is too vivid.
In my hand I hold the murder weapon, a knife.
<Page46>
"She's......dead."
Of course.
If she's still alive, she's not human.
<Page47>
"Wh......y?"
There's nothing, nothing at all.
Right now, with my own hands.
Didn't Tohno Shiki's hands easily rip a woman to pieces?
<Page48>
"Did... I kill...her?"
Yes, definitely.
Or is that not the case?
I have no reason to. So no, it can' t be. But there never was a reason. That's why it's different, it's different. I'm the only one here. There was another person here a moment ago, but now I'm the only one alive. So no. It has to be. But there's no reason, there's no reason, I didn't want to, I wasn't, I wasn't in my right mind. I was never sane in the first place. So it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not...
<Page49>
---Red blood spread on the marble floor.
Wet and sticky...
I can feel the red blood on my feet.
<Page50>
".................. Ah!"
I lifted my shoes in surprise, but not in time.
The woman's red blood, like coal tar, sticks to my feet and the floor.
<Page51>
"-------"
Aaah. Aah. Red, blood.
Because you broke her apart, even now, the disgusting color continues to flow sluggishly.
<Page52>
"It wasn't me."
No, that's wrong.
No, no, no. No. No, it's not, it's definitely not.
This is, this is...
C:>a really bad dream.
C:>..no, this is reality.
