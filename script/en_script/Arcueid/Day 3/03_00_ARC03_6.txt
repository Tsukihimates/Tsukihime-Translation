...... Somewhere, I hear the sound of rain.
It's a long, dense drizzle of rain.
<Page2>
"-----"
I'm dizzy.
My throat hurts when I breathe.
"hur....ts"
A voice comes up.
"---- Shiki-sama?"
Just then, I heard someone's voice and presence nearby...
<Page3>
"It's---my room."
Before I know it, I'm lying down in my own room.
I put on the glasses from my bedside table.
<Page4>
"Good morning, Shiki-sama."
"Hisui ......?"
"Yes. How are you feeling?"
"………"
<Page5>
Hisui asked me a strange question.
There's nothing wrong with your body.
<Page6>
"Why?"
Yes, why?
Why am I sleeping in this place?
<Page7>
"I... kil......."
I almost said, "I killed someone," but I covered my mouth.
That's the only word that my reason tells me not to say.
<Page8>
"Hisui ......, why am I here?"
"Don't you remember ......, Shiki-sama?"
Hisui frowned faintly.
<Page9>
"We received a call from the school saying that you had left early. Nee-san went to look for you and found you resting in the park."
"The park... the park nearby?"
<Page10>
"Yes. You were resting on a bench and then walked back to the residence on your own."
"...... No way. I don't remember that at all.
<Page11>
"I don't think it's so strange that you don't remember.
Your consciousness could have been clouded by weakness caused by anemia."
<Page12>
".................."
...... I don't remember any of it.
But there is no doubt about what Hisui said.
<Page13>
"...... Oh, it's already nine o'clock at night. ...... I didn't notice it."
"Yes. When you got back here, you said you wanted to rest in your room. I tried to call for a doctor, but you said, 'It's the usual'."
<Page14>
"I see.
It's true that anemia is always a problem, but..."
<Page15>
...... It was different this time.
I've killed someone...no, wait.
<Page16>
"Hisui. What was I wearing?"
"What?"
"What was I wearing? My shirt, my shoes, there was bloo...
They were all wet and sticky."
<Page17>
"If you are talking about your uniform, it was dirty so I washed it."
"Did you simply wash my bloody clothes...?!"
<Page18>
"...... It's true that it was covered in mud, but there was no stain of blood. Besides, it was only your shirt and pants that were dirty, not your jacket or anything else."
<Page19>
"------"
...... Unbelievable.
I was kneeling in a pool of blood and my legs and arms were red. ......?
<Page20>
"Shiki-sama, did you have a bad dream or something?
You must have had a terrible nightmare your face is still pale."
Hisui is staring at me.
<Page21>
"Maybe it was what you were dreaming of?"
Was it all a dream?
That feeling.
The smell of blood.
That miraculous white woman.
"Yeah, that's right. That was a bad dream."
<Page22>
I let out a long breath.
---- That's right.
It was a bad dream.
It's not like I was going to break a promise I made to Sensei when I was little and do something like that for no reason.
<Page23>
"Oh, ----, I'm awake."
"If you're feeling up to it, I can prepare dinner for you.
<Page24>
"Oh. Right, dinner."
... Even if that was a dream, I still can't get the color and smell of that blood out of my mind.
<Page25>
"I'm sorry, I don't feel like it.
I'm going to sleep like this tonight. Thanks Hisui."
"Yes. anything else, Shiki-sama?"
"You told me that I came back in the evening. Akiha said anything?"
<Page26>
"Akiha-sama wasn't at home at that time, she came home about two hours ago and I told her about your condition."
<Page27>
What about it？ asked Hisui silently.
<Page28>
"It's nothing, really.
I've been here for three days, and I'm sure she's disgusted by the trouble I've caused her."
<Page29>
"...... It is true that Akiha-sama was worried, but she did not seem upset."
Hisui took a step back.
<Page30>
"Now, if you will excuse me.
If you need anything else, please let me know."
<Page31>
"Oh, thank you. ---And I forgot to ask one more thing.
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"It's raining outside, isn't it? I wonder how long it's been raining."
"It started before you arrived. When Nee-san found you, you were soaked in the rain."
<Page32>
"..............."
No. I don't even remember that happening.
I must have been very anemic. ....... I should've just stayed home and rested.
<Page33>
"Good night. I'm really sorry about today.
Please tell Kohaku-san I said thanks."
"Very well. ---Good night."
<Page34>
"It was a dream."
...... The words I muttered were cold and chilly.
I can't really feel it at all.
The realization that what I was thinking,
was actually a dream.
<Page35>
Outside, there is the sound of rain.
My head is still faintly heavy.
I look at my chest.
.....The old scars from seven years ago are still clearly visible, like burn marks.
<Page36>
"...... Ah."
On the desk in the room is a knife, a memento from father.
"-----"
...... It was a dream.
It was nothing more than a dream.
I close my eyelids, repeating this to myself as if to deceive myself.
<Page37>
...... I exhale a long, long breath, as if I'm trying to clear my lungs of the scent that I've taken in.
I surrender to the dark sleep that cuts off my consciousness.
<Page38>
When I was a child.
I think someone told me not to tell lies that I couldn't even fool myself with.
