-------It's cold.
　Before I know it, the sun is going down.
<Page2>
------- I wonder how long it has been now.
　I'm not sure.
　My eardrums are filled with a noisy, rasping sound.
<Page3>
　Ta-da. Ta-da. Zaaa.
The sound doesn't stop, and I'm terribly cold.
　I feel like I'm going to die if I stay sitting on the bench.
　I feel like I could ...... die.
<Page4>
　Throbbing nerves, coarse body heat.
I don't care about anything.
I don't care about the repeating sound.
　I don't care that I'm going to freeze to death.
<Page5>
　My body is shaking.
　Is it the cold, anxiety, fear, or regret?
　I can't understand anything anymore.
I killed a woman and I can't explain why I did it.
<Page6>
　I just wanted to kill her, so I did.
　It's an insane reason.
...... Oh, how easy it would be if I were insane. That would explain everything.

Yet my mind is still intact.
I committed a murder and shamelessly tremble in my sanity.
<Page7>
I look at my numb fingers and see that the knife is still there.
　---Death.
The solution is simple.
<Page8>
But I can't.
Because I'm still sane, I can't do it.
There is still the fear of death, and contempt for the fact that such a thing will not solve or atone for anything.
<Page9>
　A pattering noise.
　My body temperature drops like a stone rolling down a hill.
　---I can't die by myself.
But if I'm left alone, I'll simply disappear.
　......Maybe that's for the best.
If I lived, a murderer would still be alive.
<Page10>
Come on.
I just need to let go.
If I die...
I die.
<Page11>
"...... Tohno-kun?"
Suddenly.
I hear someone call out my name.
<Page12>
"---------"
......I look up
　There, for what seems like the first time in decades, I see Senpai.
<Page13>
"What's the matter with you, sitting out here in the rain?
"............Ah"
<Page14>
　......I see. The sounds I heard earlier were rain.
No wonder I'm cold. Looking at me, my whole body must be wet.
<Page15>
"You don't even have an umbrella.
You'll catch a cold without one."
<Page16>
......Senpai's voice sounds like a foreign language.
It's was a voice I had heard only a few hours ago, but now it sounded so far away.
<Page17>
"Can you hear me ......?"
"Oh... yeah. Yeah, I can.
Maybe I should catch a cold."
I can't think of anything else the say, I can only think of the emotions tightening my throat.
<Page18>
"No, not even if it's just October. If you stay in the rain like this, you won't just catch a cold..."
<Page19>
Senpai's hand graps mine, which has fallen down.
She must be concerned about me slumped over on the bench.
<Page20>
"How long have you been like this, Tohno-kun? ......?
　Your body, its so cold!"
<Page21>
Senpai quickly grabs my arm and forces me to get up from the bench.
<Page22>
"I'll lend you my umbrella, but you must go home and warm yourself at once. Your life is in danger."
<Page23>
"......in danger?"
　...... I see. That's why I didn't moved.
　It was a lie that I couldn't think.
It's because I wanted to move, so I didn't.
<Page24>
"Hang on, please! If you can't move, why don't I call your house?"
"..............."
No, that's not good.
<Page25>
I keep my head down.
　　　　　　　　　　　Without looking Senpai in the face,
I shake my head, saying, "Please don't do that."
<Page26>
"'It's ...... okay. I can't go home.
......There's nowhere I can go."
<Page27>
　That's right.
　I can't go home with this bloody body.
There's no place for me to rest.
<Page28>
"------"
A long silence.
Senpai wordlessly stares at me.
<Page29>
"Okay. Let's go to my apartment. It's closer than your house, so it's perfect."
She pulls me by the arm.
<Page30>
"..............."
I can't shake her off.
There was no heat left in my body. I don't even have the strength stand up by myself.
<Page31>
......I wonder if that's why.
In the midst of my numbed senses, the warmth of Senpai's chilled hand felt like the only thing that was certain.
