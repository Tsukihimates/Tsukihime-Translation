"I'm home, Tohno-kun. Thank you for taking care of me."
<Page2>
Senpai is holding a number of plastic bags in her hands. She seems to have bought a lot of things.
<Page3>
"Let's see, please change into these for now.
They are cheap, but it's much better than wet clothes. The bath will be ready soon, so if you take a bath and relax, you'll feel a little better."
<Page4>
"............"
Senpai prepared quickly and efficiently.
I'll be able to take a bath and change my clothes.
...... This person.
There's no need for her to do that for me.
<Page5>
"...... It's okay, senpai.
I'm leaving. I can't cause you any more trouble."
<Page6>
I unbutton my shirt, grab my jacket and start walking.
...... Anyway, I can't stay in this room.
<Page7>
"What?" "No, you can't go out with a pale face like that!　At least warm up properly first..."
<Page8>
Senpai's hand reaches out.
As if to stop me as I pass by.
I tried to shake it off,
<Page9>
Through a coincidence without any malice, the way of the world has changed completely.
<Page10>
"------, ah
　The world is off. It's off. It's off. It's off .
　The world is disconnected. Death comes within seconds.
　A world where everything dies so easily.
　A world as seen by a murderer who kills for no reason.
　There,
<Page11>
"Aww, glasses glasses ......!　I'm sorry, that was careless of me!　If it's broken, I'll pay for it!"
　There was a <dead face> of a good person who rushed to pick up the glasses
<Page12>
"Aaahhh!!!" 
Desperate scream while holding both eyes coming out
<Page13>
　No, it's not. This is just reality as it appears to be.
　It's not happening. It's not happening yet.
　Yeah, but the blood, the red line, it's running.
　Just like the white woman.
　Just like that time.
　Even this person who cared for me is seeing red death.
<Page14>
"Tohno-kun ......!?"
<Page15>
　Then I'll repeat it. I'm sure I'll repeat myself.
　It didn't matter if I was rational or not.
　I didn't care if I was crazy or insane.
　It's time to get comfortable.
　This is who I am.
　This is the kind of creature I was.
　My mere presence was no different than hell.
　So somewhere in my heart I knew that it was a natural way for me to screw things up for no reason at all.
<Page16>
　---No, that's not it.
　I can't hear senpai's voice.
　But I can read the warmth in her eyes.
<Page17>
　...... Even if everything I see is hell, the reality is here regardless of that.
　I believe, deep down, that it must continue to exist.
<Page18>
　I hope this person cares for me.
　So that I can still recognize it properly.
　The world that will continue to live on unchanged and independent of me.
<Page19>
　I calm my ruptured heart.
　I pick up my glasses from the floor and slowly put them back on.
<Page20>
"---Huh. Aaah..."
　I sobbed and suppressed my feelings.
　I fell on my buttocks and exhaled heavily.
<Page21>
Ahhh...
　Senpai still doesn't recognize, but her believes are as normal
<Page22>
"Good. Have you calmed down, Tohno-kun?"
　When I looked up, there was senpai.
<Page23>
"You see, you still can't walk properly, can you?
　Do you understand that your body is getting cold?"
<Page24>
Regret that!, Weridly smiles as she holds my hand
I look all upset, nobody looks to notice it
<Page25>
"...... I'm sorry. But that wasn't a physical problem."
<Page26>
"No, it's a physical problem!　You have to understand that you can't stand up by yourself. You see, you're not putting in any effort at all.
I think the current Tohno-kun can carry himself."
　Saying that, senpai pulled my hand.
<Page27>
"Oh, and ......!"
　I was forcibly taken back to the middle of the room.
　...... I didn't think I'd actually be carried away.
<Page28>
"Tohno-kun, you're not going home today, are you?
　I've already made preparations for tonight, so please be prepared."
"Prepared...Senpai?"
<Page29>
"Please don't leave until you've properly warmed up, eaten dinner, and gotten yourself together. If you leave with a face like that, I won't be able to sleep because I'm worried about you."
<Page30>
"--------"
　A different kind of heartache.
　Senpai's concern seemed to break my heart, so I turned my head and exhaled.
<Page31>
On one hand, I'm so happy that I'm about to cry, but on the other hand, I'm afraid of this person's kindness.
<Page32>
"...... Why?"
"Yes?　What is it, Tohno-kun?"
"...... Why are you going that far, senpai?
　To me..."
　---I've killed a person.
<Page33>
"...... I'm no good.
　I just made a terrible mistake and ran away without taking responsibility, I even thought I could die..."
<Page34>
　I'm trying to cling to senpai here.
　That sin.
　He's trying to pretend that the life he killed with his own hands never happened.
<Page35>
"......No matter what I do, my mistakes will not be forgiven. ...... No, I don't think it should be allowed.
　So it's no good. I don't deserve to be treated kindly by my seniors like this."
<Page36>
"...... Haha. Tohno-kun, you're trying to make yourself out to be a bad person. It seems you've been waiting to be judged like that for a long time."
"What ......?"
<Page37>
"But if you think that way, it means you're not sure of your own actions, Tohno-kun.
　You always think it's your fault. Today was a prime example. But you can't figure out if it was really a good thing or a bad thing.
　That's why you have to push yourself one way or the other to make it clear.
<Page38>
"---No, that's..."
<Page39>
　　...... I couldn't say no.
　I admit what I've done.
　But I can't get rid of the strong question. Why, why did I do what I did? I'm still trying to figure out if that was my problem or not.
<Page40>
　　...... No. I know that I will never be able to understand how I felt at that time.
<Page41>
"But I don't know what the mistake you made was.
　To be frank, I don't care about that."
<Page42>
"You say that you don't deserve to be treated kindly, but that's for your own reasons.
　I'm not being nice to you for your sake, so please don't worry so much about it."
<Page43>
"It's not for me. ......?"
<Page44>
"Yes. #......
You see... I'm doing this because I want to be nice to you. In short, it's my hobby. Your situation doesn't really matter.
　Even if you're a bad person, I'll reach out to you. Well, that's not going to happen in a million years."
<Page45>
"What do you mean by 'hobby', ...... senpai, is helping people a hobby?"
　She was so assertive that I couldn't help but let out a slight laugh.
　Senpai was not offended, on the contrary, she was proud as if she understood what I meant.
<Page46>
"Yes. This time I'm not helping people, I'm just a person who enjoys forcing a boy who wants to be alone to stay with me.
　I'm sure it's annoying for you, but please think of it as being caught by a bad senpai and give up."
<Page47>
　Senpai laughed as she said that.
　It was a soft, considerate smile.
<Page48>
"..............."
　That broke my heart completely.
　She said he'd help Tono Shiki, whom even I couldn't trust.
　She said that even if I was a bad person, she would help me because she wanted to.
<Page49>
　...... no matter how unforgivable it is.
　I was saved by her words.
<Page50>
"...... I see. Thank you, senpai."
　It's not that she believed in Tohno Shiki, but that there was someone like him, and he breathed deeply.
<Page51>
"No, no, no need to thank me. It's because i'm your senpai."
　She smiled proudly and bowed her head from the bottom of her heart.
　I found myself feeling the warmth of my own heartbeat, which I had been so reluctant to hear.
<Page52>
　...... I really can't look up.
　As long as I am in front of this person, I can no longer think of myself as evil...
