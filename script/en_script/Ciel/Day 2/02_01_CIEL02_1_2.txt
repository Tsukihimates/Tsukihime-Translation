　I'll just take it easy and buy some bread.
The financial situation from now on is going to be tough.
The head of our family is not a playful person, so there isn't any hope for extra income.
<Page2>
　Therefore, I want to keep my expenses as low as possible. It would be too embarassing to be broke in a case of emergency.
<Page3>
I go to the purchasing department and buy some affordable bread and tea.
It was more crowded than usual because of the new products they brought in, so it took a while. The bento group had already finished their lunch and were chatting.
<Page4>
"Tohno-kun, are you going to have lunch now?
"Yeah, there's no one making noise, so i can take it easy, what about you, Yumizuka-san?
<Page5>
"I've already done that.
I've already finished, and i've got some leftover side dishes. ...... How about a side dish for lunch?
<Page6>
"------"
I observe a group of girls to make sure they don't notice me.
A few of them are gathering around and discussing the situation between me and Yumizuka.
...... Whatever the reason, it is clear that Yumizuka will be teased by the girls if I refuse.
<Page7>
"I appreciate it. Bread alone is tasteless, and I'm grateful for the meal."
I clasped my hands together and thanked Yumizuka.
<Page8>
"Yes, indeed , it feels lonely with only bread!
Here you go!　Fried tofu and clams in tsukudani!"
<Page9>
　It was a strange combination.
The fried tofu was made by her mom, but the tsukudani was apparently made by Yumizuka. For her sake, I'll comment that the taste was fine.
Anyway, I think it made for a spectacular lunch.
<Page10>
"Thanks for the food, it was delicious.
I'll return the favour next time I find an oppurtunity."
"No, it's okay, today was just a coincidence!
Well, anyways. ...... Oh yeah!　Did you hear about Tohyama-sensei?"
<Page11>
"Tohyama-sensei's story...,oh! you mean the one from yesterday?
I've heard rumours that something awful happened"
<Page12>
"Yeah!　You know, I heard that was a mistake!
I heard he was involved in a car accident and broke his leg, so he had to be hospitalized."
<Page13>
"Well, that's good. Oh, no, that's not good.
If you're hospitalized because of a leg injury, it means you can't walk, right? Tohyama-sensei's going to be pissed at me for messing with him."
<Page14>
"Ah .......
You're right, I don't know why i'm so happy.......
　I'm sorry, I didn't think it through ......."
<Page15>
Yumizuka's smile changed to one of remorse.
　But I understand how she feels.
Even if it was just a rumor, they had said that he died. She can't help but feel relieved when she found out it was just a leg injury.
<Page16>
"Don't worry about it, I feel the same way you do.
Then again, We won't have a homeroom teacher for a while. It's going to be lonely without him."
"Yeah, I hope he recovers soon and returns."
<Page17>
I got caught up in Yumizuka's smile and my mouth loosened up a bit as well.
She isn't incredibly beautiful or anything, but she has a charm that makes everyone around her feel at ease.
<Page18>
Or rather, her good nature has made her a trustworthy "advisor" in the class.
<Page19>
She's a laid-back person, but She's popular.
She was nominated as a class committee member with the silent consent of the class, and although she humbly said that she couldn't do it herself, she has been able to do it up to now, which is a virtue of Yumizuka's character. ...... Or rather, it is because of her good character.
<Page20>
".................."
I found myself with only two minutes left until the end of lunch break.
I've heard some good news, and without the annoying Arihiko, I think I can spend the afternoon in peace.
"..................
By the way.
Why isn't she going back to her desk?
<Page21>
"Yumizuka-san, it's almost fifth period."
"What?　Oh, yeah, I know, one minute, one minute until the bell rings!"
<Page22>
"Ah. Everyone will probably go back to their seats after the bell rings, so there's still time."
"No, I don't know, I don't have much time, but I think now is the time to take my chances when Inui isn't here, you know..."
"?"
<Page23>
Everyone begins to take their seats before the chime. And then...
<Page24>
"Well, you know!
Here, I have some left over, do you want to use it Tohno-kun?"
<Page25>
　Yumizuka held out what looked like a card. This is a ...... family restaurant's loyalty card ......?
<Page26>
"Oh, Thanks, but is it fine?"
"No, I've got a lot of points!
　Well, my friend was in a pinch, so I applied for a part-time job and the manager gave me a bunch of cards!　Come eat with us when you feel like it!　At 7pm or something like that!"
　Yumizuka ran to her seat as if she was rolling.
<Page27>
　The bell rang.
"..................."
I'm really happy, but I can't be honest about it.
That's because yesterday at lunch, Arihiko had asked me to talk about something like that.
<Page28>
We had just finished talking about the Tohno family and wereabout to finish our lunch.
"By the way, about Yumizuka...
Do you have feelings for her, or do you want to go out with her?"
　I didn't even ask for this kind of life advice.
<Page29>
"............. Why are you talking about that now?
"Well, you approached me this morning, didn't you? I was just curious. Yumizuka is the idol of the class. If there is any chance that you have a pulse for her, I'd like to stop you."
"What?　What's that? It's none of your business what I think of Yumizaka."
<Page30>
"Of course not. I just don't want to see a situation where both of us are unhappy."
Yumizuka looks like that, but she's more like ......
Oh well. It's certainly not for me to interfere with.
So, what do you think? Are you going to go out with her? If she's made so many moves, you'd think she'd be your girlfriend right away, right?"
<Page31>
"...... I think that would be difficult."
"Huh, Yumizaka isn't your type?"
"That's not what I meant. I'm warning you, Yumizuka-san is my type. I'll do my best to stop you if you try to take her."
<Page32>
"Then why are you keeping your distance? Are you her dad?"
" ....I don't know what to say, but looking at Yumizuka-san makes me sad for some reason."
"That's awful"
"You want to stay as "just friends", even if she approaches you?"
<Page33>
"...... I can't stop thinking about my own selfish thoughts."
But there is nothing I can do about it.
<Page34>
"Subconsciously, I tend to avoid... people who have decent values... and whom I can respect.
　It's not that I don't like them, it's more like I'm afraid to approach them."
<Page35>
"............ mmm."
I have a card that has exactly 1,000 yen worth of points saved up on it.
　The name of the restaurant is Lindberg. It is a very average family restaurant located at the north exit of Soya Station.
