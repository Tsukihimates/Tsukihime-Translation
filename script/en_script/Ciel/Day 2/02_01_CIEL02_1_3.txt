<Page1>
　As soon as I stepped out into the hallway, I ran into a familiar senpai.
<Page2>
"What's the matter, senpai?
　Do you have something to do in the second year classroom?
<Page3>
"'Yes, of course. It's not exactly with the second year's classroom, but a certain person in the class.
Ciel-senpai smiled and walked upto me.
<Page4>
"I just bought a very nice product at the purchasing department, but I got carried away and bought too much.
I can't eat it all by myself, so I've just come to get someone that's free!
<Page5>
"Oh. You've come to get me?
<Page6>
From the looks of it, no student has free time on their hands, but anyone would make time if they were invited by senpai. In fact, there'd be a queue.
Even with all that, though.
<Page7>
"You can't come to the second year classrooms, you're a senior. If you want to invite someone, please invite your third year classmates. You'll have a better conversation that way.
<Page8>
"That's true, but I'm in the mood to talk to a younger boy today. I just feel like it, so please don't ask me why.
Saying that, senpai quickly came close to me.
<Page9>
"That's why. Tohno-kun, are you free?
"Well. ...... that's....
I'm just going to have lunch, though."
<Page10>
"Gotcha then. Let's both eat together.
Along with a nice meal, I'd like to have Tohno-kun's time as well."
<Page11>
"------"
With a smile on her face, she pulled my sleeve with a curl of her fingers.
It was really just a small gesture, but it was filled with a mysterious compulsion that I could not resist.
<Page12>
I went out to the courtyard.
It was now deepening into autumn, and even though it was sunny, the temperature was chilly.
The students who eat lunch in the courtyard seem to be those who love the elegance of the place, and senpai seems to be one of them.
<Page13>
"Oh, the benches are unusually empty today.
You're a lucky man, Tohno-kun!"
<Page14>
Senpai sat down on the bench with a light step.
I followed her example and sat down next to her, keeping a little distance.
<Page15>
"So, what's this new product in the purchasing department?
Crab cream croquette rolls that vanished a year ago?"
　...... There used to be a great menu like that.
It was so expensive that it was discontinued within a week, but many students are still waiting for it to return.
<Page16>
"Fufufu, well you see......."
Senpai smiled as if melting with joy, placed the paper bag on her lap and took out four side dishes from inside.
<Page17>
"Ta-da! It's been a week since I advised the purchasing department's stocking routes! At last! We are able to sell authentic bakery products!"
<Page18>
　It was an oval-shaped, chunky loaf of bread that spilled slightly from the palm of her hand.
It was a deep fried bread with a dark brown surface that glistened with oil.
　All four were the same size and design.
For the most part, it was freshly fried curry bread.
<Page19>
"Good ...... This is as good as freshly baked ...... At 300 yen per piece, they are rather expensive, but it is no exaggeration to say that they are the ultimate in student luxury.
Here you go, Tohno-kun. I'll give you a special half, don't hesitate.
<Page20>
"...... No, um... Senpai.
　It's the curry bread sold at the famous bakery in front of the station, right?
<Page21>
"Hoi?
　It's not "hoi".
I don't like it when people look at me like, "Are you sure you're from Earth, if this doesn't make you happy?" 
<Page22>
"It was the same yesterday. ...... Senpai, do you like spicy food?"
For some reason, I avoided saying "Do you like curry?"
<Page23>
"Yes, yes, well. But it's not that I like it if it's spicy, it's just that I find certain flavors very delicious. ...... Yes, that's right. No matter how much I like it, having all four of them taste the same was a bit of a no-brainer. ......"
<Page24>
Good. ...... Looks like she's aware atleast.
<Page25>
"But I understand. If you like something, you have to buy a little too much of it or you'll get uneasy.
Well, I'll take your word for it, feel free."
<Page26>
I picked up one of the curry buns spread out on senpai's lap and took it into my mouth.
<Page27>
"Itadakimasu." ....... Mmmmmm. The outside is crunchy, the bread is slightly sweet with a hint of oil, and the inside is packed with ingredients. ...... Yes, it's delicious. It's really delicious, senpai."
<Page28>
I'm not used to eating this kind of food, so it feels fresh.
I used to avoid fried bread because of its high oil content, but it is very tasty if you eat it occasionally.
<Page29>
"But, senpai, are you gonna be okay? Curry and fried bread is hard on the stomach. I think it's too much for a girl."
"Oh, really?
Let's see, ...... I have PE afterwards, so I think I can digest it without any problem."
<Page30>
"............"
If it's physical education, shouldn't you choose something that's extraordinarily good for your digestion? I'm not sure what senpai was thinking.
<Page31>
"I can take care of my health, you know
Oh, but I need tea. Can I have some barley tea, Tohno-kun?"
<Page32>
"Oui, Japanese people always drink thé d'orge(barley tea), right?
Whoa, got an extra curry bun!"
"Kyaa~"
<Page33>
It's not surprising that senpai were surprised.
I wondered how long he had been sneaking up on us, but he reached behind the bench, proudly snatched a piece of curry bread, and finished it in one bite.
<Page34>
"I see, this one' s good. It's so good. It tastes more like curry than anything else. It's too much of a treat for me when I just woke up hungry!
No, it's a little hard on the stomach, but the spirit of senpai makes it even!"
<Page35>
　Hahaha, said Arihiko with a hearty laugh.
This guy saw me and Ciel-senpai together and sneaked up on us. ......!
<Page36>
"Arihiko...... Why are you so good at getting in people's way? Is it a curse from a previous life? Or are you just that kind of creature?"
<Page37>
"Heh heh heh, no sneaking around. It's not like I'm trying to get a good meal by myself.
If you're having lunch, why don't you let me join you? I gave up my seat yesterday, so it's your turn to give up your seat today, isn't it?"
<Page38>
　In Arihiko's mind, yesterday's lunch was "saving a seat for senpai". He has a very convenient mind.
<Page39>
"...... Oh. Sorry, senpai. Some idiot in my class was rude. I know I'm saying this, but I was useful yesterday, so let me sit. ...... Senpai?"
I look from Arihiko to senpai.
and.
<Page40>
"I'm sorry, but request denied.
Inui-kun, please clench your teeth there."
<Page41>
　Then, I saw senpai quickly stand up and take a fighting stance.
<Page42>
　Senpai's left jab cut through the air with a whoosh.
"What are you so proud of?"
Even for us amateurs, it was perfect shadowboxing.
<Page43>
"She' s mad as hell over a mere bite of curry bread."
<Page44>
I'm sorry, 
I was just snatched on the tip of my nose, help me Tohno, do something and apologize to Senpai!#ERROR
I pull him away from me.
I pull him away from me.

<Page45>
"Oh, as expected of Tohno, nice sentiment! I'm sorry, senpai, but the grabbing of the food was more of a spur of the moment thing, or a flirting thing, or an attempt to have lunch with senpai, you know?

<Page46>
"I see. That's what you wanted.

But I don't see a suitable ticket. If it's lunch, shouldn't you bring something to eat?"

"Okay, got it! I'll get it as soon as I can!"

<Page47>
Arihiko ran away at once.

Ciel-senpai sat back down on the bench as if nothing had happened,

<Page48>
"I'm also troubled by Inui-kun.

Not only did he not say "Itadakimasu", but he also swallowed it in one bite, lacking a sense of appreciation for the food.

Well, I'll give him a pass this time, since he's made two very brilliant comments.

She shrugged her shoulders and said something like a senior student.

<Page49>
"Hey, guys! I've bought the tickets!"

"Oh."
"Gee."

Arihiko came back in about five minutes.

In his hands, he was carrying two swollen paper bags.

<Page50>
"Oh, man, that's a lot of ......."

"What do you think? I bought up as much as I could. ---I was hoping it would calm her down."

<Page51>
I see. ...... That's how powerful it was.

That must have been a fear that only the person who was being targeted could feel.

<Page52>
"No, two paper bags full of curry bread is still too much. It's not like croquettes on a plate, how are you going to clean this up?"

<Page53>
"If you can't finish it, leave it. It will be fine for a while, so you can snack on it until tomorrow's lunch.
That's why, yes, Senpai.
I apologize for earlier and offer to share lunch with you."
<Page54>
"Well, well, thank you very much for your kindness.
Please come to the bench, Inui-kun. I'll just stand there.
"What are you talking about?#Please sit down, senpai.

Please sit down, senpai.
Going out after school?"

<Page55>
Going out after school?
"On the contrary, inside the school.Since you weren't here this morning, you don't even know that a new teacher has replaced Toyama. #What a shame. She's so beautiful that the guys in my class are so excited about her."

<Page56>

...... So, what's she like? I'm not really into high-handed female teachers."

"She looks like she was a trainee until last year. #You like older women who are patient, don't you? Good for you. She' s 25, exactly how you like it."

<Page57>
"She looks like she was a trainee until last year.
<Page58>
"Oh. Inui-kun, do you prefer older women?

"Yes, I do. Older women are not troublesome.

Well. if she's cute I can go a year younger."

<Page59>
"Hmhmm... So you're good at both pampering and bullying?

By the way, what about you Tohno-kun? Do you like older women?"

<Page60>
"I've never been particularly conscious of it, but I don't think I'm as liberal as Arihiko."

"Ehh . Wait... You're so annoying. I can smell a sissy killer from Tohno. Isn't there no shortage of stories about tutors and doctor's daughters and that sort of thing?"
g?
<Page61>
"Shut up. Just shut up. I've never hired a tutor in the first place.

<Page62>
"Hoh. #So, do you know the daughter of the doctor?


"Shut up. Just shut up. I've never hired a tutor in the first place.
Ciel-senpai, please don't fall for Arihiko's nonsense!"

<Page63>
"It's not nonsense though. But it's true. In fact, you ran off and had lunch with an older student."

<Page64>
"That's right. Tohno-kun was walking so unguardedly, I was tempted to take him with me. It was like running into a rabbit in a snowfield."

"Well, he' s actually a cold-blooded creature in a rabbit's skin. Spiders, scorpions, that kind of machine-like creature."

<Page65>
Senpai and Arihiko laugh at each other.

I want to raise an objection, but I'm afraid I'll end up being a snake, so I stay silent.

And the curry bread is steadily dwindling.

I would like to correct my earlier comment about the croquettes on the plate. The mountain of fried bread is now being consumed like a snack.

There are less than 20 minutes left before the lunch break ends.

What will be the fate of the curry breads?

<Page66>
The chit-chat continued until the end of the lunch break.

Arihiko and I would talk about stupid things, Ciel would insert her opinion, and the conversation would start all over again. We were running out of curry bread.

The time passed like sand.

<Page67>
"Oops, I'm starting to get a headache. Gotta be hungry. ...... No, wait,

I don't think I ate anything. I don't think I could have eaten anything. ......

Oh well, I'm getting sleepy, so I'll run to the infirmary.

See you later, senpai,and next time just the two of us!"

<Page68>
Arihiko ran off to the infirmary, seemingly intent on skipping the afternoon as well.

<Page69>
"Oh dear. I know I should be careful, but strangely enough, I've become lenient toward Inui-kun. I wonder if it's part of his virtue."

Ciel looked away from Arihiko in dismay.

<Page70>
"He does the bare minimum. He takes care of his own problems. I think you should trust him and leave him alone."

<Page71>
"I see. You're right, I do feel that way.

You've known Inui-kun for a long time, so you know him well."

<Page72>
"It's just a rotten relationship. I'm sure you found that out already.

He's an idiot through and through."

Although I said a swear word, senpai kept her gentle smile.

<Page73>
"...... Eh. What's with the smile?"

"No, no. You' re smiling, so I'm smiling along with you. We had a good time today, didn't we?"

<Page74>
"------"

I noticed my smile when she said that.

It was definitely a good time.

Come to think of it, I've never spent time in the courtyard like this before.

<Page75>
"...... Yes, it was. It was kind of fun.

I've never been out in the courtyard much. But I think I've seen something like this before. Was it when I met you Ciel-senpai?"

<Page76>
I recalled the memory of the first time I met senpai.

Senpai is...

"Yes, there have been many moments like this.

I'm sure they're too many to count."

She said this with a sincere smile.
