I walked out into the hallway towards the stairs.
Whether I wanted to go to the cafeteria or to the store, I had to get down to the first floor.
<Page2>
.........
On my way down to the first floor, I encountered something strange.
The new teacher, Noel-sensei, is standing in the hallway doing nothing.
<Page3>
It is unusual for a teacher to be in the hallway during lunchtime.
At our school, teachers usually have lunch in the staff room, the preparation room, or the teacher's area in the cafeteria.
There is no reason for them to spend time on the stairwell.
　Could it be ......
<Page4>
"Sensei. You aren't lost by any chance are you?"
I'm sure that's not the case, but just to be sure, I called out to her.
<Page5>
"Oh my, do i look that unreliable?
It's just a change of pace, a little relaxation.
because the staff room is so homey."
<Page6>
"We'll only be with you for a short time, but please consider us family."
　It's a little bit of a shock, isn't it?
I wasn't prepared to attend a welcome party on the first dayof the job.
Isn't it scary when everyone is smiling?"
"Huh. Well, yeah....
<Page7>
The one who was bewildered was me.
Noel-sensei's frank remarks made me agree with her as if we were friends.
<Page8>
"Right?　I naively thought that high school teachers must be exhausted from dealing with all the kids who act like they are adults.
　She's so tough and positive. And the smile.
I'm confident in my smile too, but I'm not as good as the other teachers."
<Page9>
As she said this, Noel-sensei put the mobile device she was holding in her hand into her suit pocket.
......She didn't look like she was on the phone or composing an email. Was she taking a picture or something?
<Page10>
"But, well, I can't keep slipping out forever, can I?
I'm giving up and going back to the staff room.
Anyway, ...... What do you mean by "are you lost? " This is a school, Or is that just a Japanese pick-up line?"
<Page11>
"No, no, not at all.
"I know, I know. I'm just messing with you.
See you later, Shiki-kun. Thank you for being so considerate♥"
<Page12>
Noel-sensei hummed as she walked down the stairs.
She's quite the fluffy teacher.
　But ......
<Page13>
"How did she know my name ......?
As the new homeroom teacher, she has already memorized the names and faces of all the students in her class.
I might have misunderstood her attitude, she might aswell be a dedicated teacher .......
