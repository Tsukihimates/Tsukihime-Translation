"I see. Then I won't say anything.
I'm glad you're fighting with me. You can "kill" Vlov with a single blow, no problem.
<Page2>
"...... No, I can' t do that.
It's too hot around him to get close.
And how are we going to find him before that?"
<Page3>
"Finding him......but Shiki you're really extreme, aren't you? If you have decide not to run, then why don't you go on the offensive?"
"I just figured it out! I don't want to hear it from you, the incarnation of extremism."
<Page4>
"I'm just an efficiency freak.
...... Well, okay. I'll tell you what, it's going to be an endurance battle from here on out.
The most reliable strategy is to escape until my strength returns.
In another three days, my strength will be restored to about 30% of its original level. With that much power, I can defeat the Vlov on my own."
<Page5>
"Three days ......?.....No, but...
"Yes. For those three days, Vlov is on the loose. He'll go underground and replenish the blood supply from the humans. ...... No, that's not all. From the looks of him, he might be roaming the streets at night.
He's not in his right mind. If he doesn't hide himself, the church will come after him, or maybe he hasn't thought of that."
<Page6>
"You can't do that. He's a fire-breathing monster. You can't leave him alone for even a day!"
<Page7>
"Then we'll have to find Vlov in daylight and kill him.
But I'm against it. I have a rough idea of where he is, but there's nothing more cautious than a sleeping Dead Apostle. It's more likely that we'll get hit back.
<Page8>
"No way. You' ve got a good idea where he is, and you're just gonna let him go......?"
"Yeah. I told you, it's none of my business how many humans fall prey to Vlov.
<Page9>
...... It takes my breath away.
I can see where Arcueid is coming from.
　Safety measures...... No, if I want to be sure, I should wait for this girl to recover from her wounds and regain her strength for now.
<Page10>
But ...... the price of that is that the more time we waste here, the more casualties there will be.
I am going to----
C:>...Find Vlov now.
C:>…At least, stay here until nightfall.
