Hmm, where did I put it nya.
What was I looking for nya.
<Page2>
I don't even remember where I got it from nya.
Although I bought three of the same one by accident nya.
<Page3>
Oh well, time to throw away everything I dont need!
Nyahaha, to the trash you go!
<Page4>
And while I'm at it, later doll protagonist!
E - N - DO - R - PH - IN, let's go!
<Page5>
Hold on a second!
You can't throw that away!
<Page6>
Eh? Ah, crap.
<Page7>
Ah.....
<Page8>
Ah.....
<Page9>
W-well, it just seems to be a doll at least ...
It shouldn't be a problem... I think...
<Page10>
True that nya.
In any case it was a synchronicity bound by fate.
<Page11>
Is this... perhaps a sign that the protagonist
will be launched into the air in spectacular fashion?
<Page12>
Hahaha. Surely not.
Even for Tohno-kun, there's no way he would do something so reckless---
<Page13>
That was the plan---
<Page14>
...wasn't it?
That was rather bold, or should I say suicidal?
<Page15>
If he wants to become a missile, just let him be.
Mmm, I do like a guy with a lot of spirit nya.
<Page16>
Perhaps the reason for the failure
is because of the wrong X and Y co-ordinates nya?
<Page17>
All three of the choices here are rather ambitious,
so there is no big difference when it comes to difficulty...
<Page18>
So please go back to the last choice
and go for a different strategy this time.
