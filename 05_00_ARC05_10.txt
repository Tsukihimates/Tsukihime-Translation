"I'm exhausted."
I roll over onto my back.
My heart and lungs scream with joy.
My breathing, which has been stopped for so long, finally resumes.// dropping the 'like anyone else nuance. 人並みに再開させた
<Page2>
My hands can no longer move.
I'm not even sure if I'm still holding the knife.
The only thing I can be sure of is the pain all over my body and my awareness that seems to fall into darkness as I relax in this very moment.
<Page3>
...I really am fortunate. My sense of pain has been numbed thanks to that.
The pain in my left foot that I broke while gliding mid-air would have been unbearable under normal circumstances. It's as if every bone in my body is being sawed away. I can hardly feel the pain that sparks from my eyes even now.
<Page4>
"But―――shit."
I don't want to, but I can't help but let the swear come out of my mouth.
<Page5>
...Nothing like lingering memories remain. // kinda weird. 生き残った余韻なんて何もない。
Nor was there any pride in accomplishing such a feat.
This was nothing like a miracle. It was just me slapping my emotions together after everything that had happened.
<Page6>
"―――――The Moon."
There is a waning moon in the night sky.
...I wonder why.
It's terribly familiar. I feel like I saw something similar in my dream at least once.
<Page7>
"Are you okay, Shiki?"
<Page8>
Arcueid walks up to me as if nothing had happened.
<Page9>
"―――Well, I'm alive, at least."
I mean it feels like I'm dying, just speaking is painful.
But I cannot allow myself to make such feeble complaints as someone who managed to make it out alive.
<Page10>
"Geez, you really don't need to be so humble.
Even if he was a newcomer, you killed a member of the Ancestors, you know?
You should be more proud of yourself."
<Page11>
Arcueid looks as happy as she can be.
...In fact, there must have been value in killing Vlov. Even I know that much.
But even so―――
<Page12>
...There was nothing I could do.
How far did that glacier encroach the city? At the very least, the carnage was even worse than at the hotel, and now I must look away again―――
"They're not dead.
If it's Vlov's curse you're worried about, I've got it all covered."
―――Or so I thought.
<Page13>
"W-What do you mean by that, ow...!!"
As soon as I strain myself to sit up, I feel a sharp pain in my left leg that sends me sprawling.
<Page14>
"Come on now, you need to lie down."
"Agh...! B-Besides that, I need you... to explain everything.
Are they really not dead...?"
<Page15>
"Yeah. When Vlov's Principle went out of control, I coated everything I could with a convective membrane.
If you had killed Vlov even a little bit later, I wouldn't have been able to follow up."
<Page16>
Arcueid readily confesses her outrageous offense.
...Speaking of which, when she...
She made a strange, sudden stop before being hit by Vlov's lance.
Was that not to protect herself, but to protect the city...?
<Page17>
...Yeah, that's right. If you think about it, it's strange that I'm still alive even after that cold wave had spread out.
Just as I was able to breathe in those super cold temperatures, the people of the city must also have been safe.
That's why―――
<Page18>
That's why she was in such a mess.
While I was only thinking of myself, she protected the entire city knowing that she would be at a disadvantage―――
<Page19>
"W―――Why would you do something like that?!
Didn't you say that you didn't care about humans?!"
In a fit of unknown rage, I yell thoughtlessly at the person before me.
Arcueid curiously raises and lowers her eyebrows, and then...
<Page20>
"Well, that's because it was what you wanted."
She says something incredibly stupid.
<Page21>
"――――――"
...Did I, say that?
When? Where? Maybe it was...
<Page22>
"But you're kind of different. After all, you've never even drunk blood before.
In that case, it's fine. Whether you're a vampire or whatever else, as long as you don't lay a hand on any of us, it's okay."
<Page23>
―――I don't believe this.
'If you don't lay a hand on any of us, it's okay'
She did it because of that?
Even when she could have been destroyed with one wrong move?
<Page24>
"Ha..."
I laugh at the ridiculous fact.
I'm even more stunned than before.
I'm stunned, but more than that, I'm more grateful than I've ever been.
<Page25>
...I close my eyelids.
With this, I think I can go to sleep now.
My chest that was filled with nothing but regret is now covered in relief.
My awareness fades away.
I forget the pain in my legs and fall into a deep sleep.
...And then.
<Page26>
I'm forcibly snapped back to reality by Arcueid's strike on my head.
"...What are you trying to pull?"// should there be a pause?
<Page27>
"You can't. If you fall asleep with such a wound, it will be more painful when you wake up right? I'll close the wound if you're going to sleep. It'll be more efficient."
<Page28>
―――That is a perfectly valid argument.
I wonder who told her that?
<Page29>
"...Arcueid. Can I give you some serious advice?"
"Hmm, what is it?"
"You know. You should stop saying such absurd things, you stupid woman."
<Page30>
That's my limit.
With that, I've really used up all my energy.
<Page31>
My consciousness fades.
Arcueid makes some noise about something, but I don't have the strength to open my eyes anymore.
<Page32>
"Ah... hold on Shiki, are you really going to fall asleep...?"
...I told you that I was sleepy.
I'll sleep before I die, so make sure to wake me up when it's morning.
<Page33>
"Are you really going to? That's definitely going to hurt. Do you really not need any healing? I'm sure you'll faint when you wake up."
―――Oh shut up.
I'm going to sleep, so if you want to do something then do it.
<Page34>
"Yeah, if that's the case then you should've told me that earlier."
After hearing the cheerful voice.
I feel the cold fingertips, colder than my body, touch my skin in a caring manner.
A feeling of joy rises from my face stronger than the drowsiness from this pleasant sensation.
<Page35>
"Spoils of war? Or rather, the Ancestor's remains?
Well, whatever! I was worried about where to throw it away anyway!"
...Slime?
<Page36>
"W-W-What, what was that feeling? Did you just apply something just now?!
Ooh, ow, oww, the pain is coming back!?
It hurts a lot, no, it's itchy, or rather, it's scary!
What the hell are you―――"
<Page37>
Right as I was about to ask what she was doing, I was attacked by a tremendous feeling of emptiness.
<Page38>
Was that shouting just now the last remaining heat in my body?
This time, my consciousness goes into a deep sleep without fighting back.
<Page39>
"It's okay, this stuff isn't bad. I can cover it up if I just use the torn-off flesh.
But I can't do much about the bones. You should definitely see a human doctor afterward."
The cold fingertips move away.
<Page40>
"Are you asleep, Shiki―――?"
―――Yeah, I really am asleep.
It's been a while since I've had such a deep sleep―――a sleep that wasn't so dreadful.
<Page41>
"It can't be helped. Your house is the mansion on top of that hill right?
I'll find a way to bring you home somehow."
―――I simply gaze fixedly at the white moon as I sleep.
<Page42>
"...You've done well, Shiki. And thank you.
I was saved tonight thanks to you."
<Page43>
Words of gratitude that didn't seem to carry any weight in the slightest.
I can't hear her voice any longer.
I fall into a deep slumber, this time without the disturbance of anyone around me.
